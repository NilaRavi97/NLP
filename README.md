Abstract: This project explores the potential of Natural Language Generation (NLG) Systems to comprehend and articulate complex arguments. NLG systems, leveraging various modalities such as voice assistants, language translators, and chatbots, have demonstrated the ability to generate coherent, human-like text from diverse inputs including text, images, audio, and databases. However, their application in understanding arguments, which are structured textual content supporting specific viewpoints or claims, poses significant challenges. The automatic interpretation of argument collections by NLG systems is gaining importance across disciplines such as law and politics, yet remains particularly challenging in the context of online discussion forums where arguments are generated by multiple users and lack plain text representation. While previous research has successfully structured argumentative representations, the correct ordering of these arguments for generating coherent text remains unclear. This project addresses this challenge by focusing on generating text from argumentative structures that incorporate user-generated content.
