Some parents encourage bigotry (racism, sexism, other social 'phobias'), turn a blind eye to shoplifting and other petty crime, encourage animal abuse like throwing rocks at strays, or think education or vaccines are optional..

Additionally, the effect of such measures on encouraging childbirth is considered against the backdrop of global overpopulation concerns.Low population growth is good for our overpopulated planet but, In developed countries, low birthrates are a major social issueas ageing populations require substantial state support while a shrinking workforce is less able to fund that support.\n",
      "summary The debate centers on whether governments should pay caregivers until children are school-aged to address low population growth. Advocates argue it recognizes the importance of parenting, while critics warn of excessive state intervention and dependency. Key topics include the policy's economic viability, family autonomy, and governmental responsibility towards equal dignity, especially for the poor. There's tension between seeing low population growth as beneficial for an overpopulated world and acknowledging the challenges of ageing populations and diminishing workforces in developed nations.\n",

      "summary The debate focuses on the proposal that governments should remunerate caregivers until children reach school age to combat low population growth. Supporters claim this would value parenting and aid population balance, while opponents fear overreliance on state aid and loss of family independence.

Critics raise concerns about the potential exploitation of such policies by people who might have children purely for financial gain.Raising a child is just as much, if not more, work than jobs which traditionally receive economic reward. because, Child rearing has not been acknowledged as work deserving of financial reward in the past because it was almost exclusively completed by women in a a patriarchal society.\n",

      "summary The debate evaluates the proposition of government subsidies for caregivers until children reach school age as a solution to declining birth rates. Advocates argue it acknowledges the value of parenting and helps maintain population balance, while critics warn against potential state dependency and a loss of family independence. Points of contention include economic impacts, support for low-income families, population aging, overpopulation risks, possible exploitation of policy, recognition of childrearing as labor, traditional values, and workforce implications. While there are concerns about people having children for monetary benefits, the policy is seen as a way to support childrearing costs without being overly lucrative. Although questions of economic feasibility arise, evidence from Germany, where parents receive a child allowance, suggests the policy could stimulate economic activity as caregivers spend on goods and services.\n"
