The debate revolves around the claim that women are superior to men in terms of physical ability. Some argue that women's higher risk of miscarriage in their 30s and inferior weightlifting records suggest otherwise. However, others point out women's achievements in endurance races and extreme sport events as evidence of their physical prowess. The debate ultimately depends on how one weighs these arguments and defines "better."
