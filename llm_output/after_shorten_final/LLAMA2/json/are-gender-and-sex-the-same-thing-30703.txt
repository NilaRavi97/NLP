Here's a 90-word summary of the debate without graph information:

The debate centers around the relationship between sex and gender, with some arguing they are not the same thing, while others believe recognizing their difference is crucial for trans and non-binary people. Some feminist theorists argue that biology is shaped by social understandings. Others claim that not everyone's gender identity aligns with their assigned sex at birth, and gender is a social/cultural construct that varies by history and culture. The debate also touches on how culture and norms shape gender expression.
