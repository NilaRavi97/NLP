  Sure, here's a summary of the debate in 90 words or less without using graph information:

The effectiveness of purity pledges in reducing teen pregnancy and STDs is debated. One side argues that pledges promote abstinence, improved contraceptive use, reduced sexual activity, and healthy relationships, while the other side counters that pledges may lead to a false sense of security, stigmatize sex, fail to address root causes like poverty and lack of access to healthcare, and even increase the risk of STDs by discouraging condom use. Both sides present several sub-arguments.
