  A wage for parents who are the primary caregivers of their children until they enter primary school is proposed to help low-income families and provide an economic incentive for population growth. Arguments in favor include recognition of child-raising benefits to society and economic support for families. Those against the measure claim it may not be economically viable, interfere with parenting practices or make parenting a paid job, rather than a labor of love. The debate revolves around feasibility and benefits of such a wage.
