  A debate surrounding the implementation of a flat "Asset Tax" on all citizens is underway. Proponents argue it would be fair, simplify the tax code, reduce wealthy people's power, provide certainty, and equalize active and passive work. Opponents counter that it could harm the equity and bond market, be difficult to accurately value assets, incentivize wealth concealment or offshore movement, ignore individual income/ability to pay, and decrease government revenue. The debate revolves around tax fairness and equality, with both sides presenting valid arguments.
