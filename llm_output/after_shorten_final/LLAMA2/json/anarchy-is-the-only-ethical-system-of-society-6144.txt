The debate centers around the viability of anarchism as a political system. Some argue that it is not a viable alternative, citing concerns about chaos and disorder (3), human nature (4), and impracticality (10). Others support anarchism, highlighting its focus on voluntary cooperation (6) and empowerment of individuals and communities (7, 8). One participant suggests that criticisms of anarchism are based on a misunderstanding of what it is (11). Ultimately, the debate showcases both the criticisms and arguments in favor of anarchism.
