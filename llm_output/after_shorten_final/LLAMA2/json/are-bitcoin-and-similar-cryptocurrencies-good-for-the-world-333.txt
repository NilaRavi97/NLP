Here's a 90-word summary of the debate without graph information:

The debate centers around the use of anonymous cryptocurrencies and their potential risks. An anonymous user can purchase items/services from a legal, but shameful, provider anonymously. The anonymous cryptocurrency can also be used for illegal activities or funding legal, but shameful, NGOs. Law enforcement or other entities may trace transactions, and the anonymous cryptocurrency exchange can support the funding of legal, but shameful, NGOs by allowing anonymous donations. The anonymous cryptocurrency funding of totally legal NGOs can also be supported by the anonymous user. Overall, the threat model highlights risks associated with anonymous cryptocurrencies, such as their potential use in illegal activities or their ability to facilitate anonymous transactions subject to legal or ethical scrutiny.
