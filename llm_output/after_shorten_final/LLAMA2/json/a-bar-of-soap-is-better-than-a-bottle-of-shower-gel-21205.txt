Soap and shower gel were debated, with pros and cons for each. Soap is long-lasting, convenient, and environmentally friendly, but can sting eyes and is difficult to wash hair with. Shower gel is more hygienic, generates less waste, and is easier to distribute, but can also sting eyes and is less convenient to use. The choice between the two depends on personal preferences and priorities.
