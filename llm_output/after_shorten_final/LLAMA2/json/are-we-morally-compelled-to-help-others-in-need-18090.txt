The debate revolves around whether people have a moral obligation to help others in need. Some argue that humans are morally compelled to assist others, citing benefits of cooperation and the natural inclination towards helping others. Others argue that morality is relative and personal, and that helping others may come at a personal cost. Some raise the question of whether there is a rational or logical basis for helping others without personal gain. The debate also touches on the distinction between utilitarianism and altruism, and how our perception of failed attempts to act for the greater good can support the idea of a moral obligation to help others.
