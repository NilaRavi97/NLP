Here's a 90-word summary of the debate without any graph information:

The debate centers on addressing psychosocial factors to prevent school shootings. Some argue it detracts from gun control efforts, while others believe both are important. Mental illness, trauma, and depression are considered key causes of mass shootings. Addressing these issues can help prevent school shootings, but it's also important to recognize that mentally ill individuals are not inherently violent and that other psychosocial factors contribute to the stigma of violence. A comprehensive approach considering both gun control and psychosocial factors is necessary to effectively prevent school shootings.
