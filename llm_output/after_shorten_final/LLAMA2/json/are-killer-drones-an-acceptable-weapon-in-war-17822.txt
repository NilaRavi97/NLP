The use of drones in warfare is a controversial issue with multiple viewpoints and arguments. Proponents argue that drones are necessary for modern warfare, effective in combat, can target enemy leaders, reduce the risk of terrorism, and help reduce the risk of casualties. Opponents argue that drones are immoral, can cause civilian casualties, and are not effective in combat. The debate also touches on the use of drones for surveillance, precision strikes, tactical operations, and strategic operations. Some argue that the use of drones is necessary for national security, while others believe it is not.
