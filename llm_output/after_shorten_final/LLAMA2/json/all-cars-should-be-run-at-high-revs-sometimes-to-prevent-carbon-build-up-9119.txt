Here's a 90-word summary of the debate without graph information:

The debate revolves around driving at high revs to burn off carbon build-up in the engine. One side argues it's beneficial, while the other claims it's dangerous and can damage the car. Some say it's not worth the trouble, while others suggest it works just as well at lower revs. There are also arguments that this method only makes a slight difference and that there are better methods to achieve the same goal.
