The American Civil War was a complex conflict involving slavery, states' rights, and economic factors. The North and South had different economic values, with the North protecting its industries and the South relying on agriculture and slavery. The Tariff of 1828 and calls for African American equality from the North threatened the South's way of life, leading to secession. President Lincoln did not emancipate all slaves in Union states, and the Emancipation Proclamation only applied to areas under Confederate control. The Corwin Amendment, which protected slavery, was proposed but not passed. The Civil War was a cultural divide between the North and South, with different views on slavery and states' rights.
