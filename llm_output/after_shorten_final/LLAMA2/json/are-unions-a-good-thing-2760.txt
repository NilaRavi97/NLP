The debate centers around the impact of unions on society, with arguments for and against their presence. Proponents argue that unions protect workers' rights, provide training, and give workers a collective voice. Opponents claim that unions can lead to higher labor costs, decreased productivity, and job losses, and can become corrupt and form monopolies. The effectiveness of unions depends on their leadership and relationships with employers.
