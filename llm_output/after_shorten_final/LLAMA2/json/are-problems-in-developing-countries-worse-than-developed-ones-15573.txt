In this debate, participants discussed the disadvantages faced by developing countries in the global economy. They argued that developing countries are more vulnerable to economic crises due to limited resources and lack of control over their economies. Developed countries have stronger negotiating power, which can lead to unfair trade agreements and other international problems. Developing countries rely on developed countries for complex products and expertise, limiting their negotiation ability. Additionally, developing countries need to maintain a good reputation to receive development money and avoid invasions or protests. The debate also touched on the idea that basic needs are not met in many developing countries, whereas they are in first-world countries. Finally, participants discussed how the problems faced by one person or group can have a butterfly effect, affecting everyone else in some way.
