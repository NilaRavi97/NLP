Background checks for online dating: Yes or No?

Proponents argue that background checks can help weed out married or separated individuals, leading to more successful relationships, and that paid sites should implement them since they require a fee. Opponents argue that personal data would be vulnerable to cyber attacks and that making online dating enjoyable outweighs the risks. Additionally, some users may not want to submit to a background check simply to go on a date.
