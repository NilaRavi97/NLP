Here's a summary of the debate in 90 words or less, without using graph information:

The debate discusses the uniqueness of human cognitive abilities compared to other animals. One argument is that humans have a larger number of neural connections, allowing for higher cognitive abilities. A counterargument states that chimpanzees possess metacognition, a human-like ability. Another claim is that all living things take in information and respond based on their operating system, but this is challenged by the fact that humans have more inputs and neurons than other animals. The debate also touches on the idea that humans have a unique moral understanding of suffering and can actively change themselves and their environment.
