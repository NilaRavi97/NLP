The role of real estate brokers is being questioned due to concerns about their competence, high commissions, and outdated practices. While some argue that brokers still provide valuable expertise, others believe their current structure needs reform. The implementation of proper legislation from governments could create services that would render brokers obsolete. However, this would be costly and burden government resources. Ultimately, the decision to hire a real estate broker depends on individual preferences and circumstances.
