Here's a 90-word summary of the debate between arranged and love marriages:

In the debate between arranged and love marriages, both types have pros and cons. Arranged marriages offer stability but limit personal choice, while love marriages provide freedom but risk divorce. A successful marriage requires mutual respect, communication, and compatibility regardless of the type of marriage. Incorporating familial validation can improve marriages, but individuals shouldn't sacrifice their happiness for family relationships. Both types of marriage can lead to happy and strong family relationships. However, arranged marriages may involve deception, as individuals may feel pressured to hide aspects of their past or future to avoid judgment from their families.
