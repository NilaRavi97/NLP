The use of killer drones in war is controversial, with both benefits and drawbacks. They can effectively deter enemies and minimize damage to future generations, but their use may lead to an increase in fatalities and spark a global arms race. Drone pilots frequently experience psychological trauma, suggesting that using drones does not diminish the ethical significance of their actions. The distance from ethical implications can lead to gratuitous use of drones, potentially resulting in increased civilian casualties. Using drones puts fewer soldiers' lives at risk, but it also has limitations in combating terrorism.
