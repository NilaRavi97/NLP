Background checks should be included on all dating sites to ensure user safety and security. Paid sites should offer this feature as part of their services, while free sites can make it optional. Despite potential risks, background checks can weed out unsuitable individuals and increase the chances of successful relationships. However, free sites shouldn't be required to implement this feature due to resource limitations. Users should proceed with caution on free dating sites, as there may not be a standard protocol for dating networks.
