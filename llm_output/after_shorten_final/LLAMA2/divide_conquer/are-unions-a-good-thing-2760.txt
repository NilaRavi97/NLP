Here's a 90-word summary of the debate over unions' impact:

Unions' impact on productivity, wages, and workplace values is debated. Some argue unions improve benefits and promote equality, while others believe they decrease productivity and lead to corruption. Studies suggest unions don't inhibit productivity and may enhance it. Unions provide a democratic outlet for workers to have a say in workplace administration, preventing worker abuse and asymmetric information in wage negotiations. However, unions can also be corrupt and form networks leading to protectionism and extortion. The impact of unions depends on leadership priorities.
