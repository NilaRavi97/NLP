The debate over exorbitant transfer fees in football raises questions of fairness and corruption. While some argue that removing fees would benefit poorer clubs and players, others see them as a form of corruption that allows rewards without merit. The practice of putting a price on humans is seen as unethical by some, but transfer fees can also be used for corruption. With so much money at play, it is likely that those involved will find ways to manipulate the system.
