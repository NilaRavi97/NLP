Here's a 90-word summary of the debate on gender and sex:

The debate distinguishes between biological traits and societal roles, personal identification, and expression. The LGBTQIA+ movement advocates for inclusivity, accuracy, and workability, especially for marginalized communities. Ensuring concepts are accurate and workable is crucial, particularly in medical and legal settings. Non-binary and trans* individuals face challenges due to the gender dichotomy, and their lived experience should be included in concepts of sex and gender to reduce obstacles they face. While sex and gender are distinct, gender is tied to sex and cannot be seen as completely independent.
