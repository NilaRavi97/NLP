The debate over constructed languages revolves around their value and purpose, with some arguing for their benefits such as enhanced literacy and creative outlets, while others believe existing languages are sufficient. Chomsky argues that innate grammar makes it impossible to create a new artificial language, but some argue that functional languages like Klingon and Dothraki can be learned through platforms like Duolingo. Most constructed languages are created for artistic purposes rather than utilitarian ones.
