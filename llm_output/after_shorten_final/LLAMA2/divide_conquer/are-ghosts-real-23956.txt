The debate over ghosts continues, with some cultures believing in their existence while others do not. While personal experiences are not considered sufficient evidence, multiple people claiming to see the same ghost can be valuable. However, the subjective nature of perception and experience makes it impossible to prove or disprove the existence of ghosts. Docu-series such as Ghost Adventures have accumulated years of unexplainable video footage, but this does not necessarily provide conclusive evidence for the existence of ghosts. It is easy to manipulate video and photo content, making it unreliable as proof. Therefore, there is no concrete evidence to support the existence of ghosts.
