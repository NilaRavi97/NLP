Here's a condensed version of the summary in 90 words:

Agile certifications are controversial. They may introduce newcomers to Agile principles, but also reinforce existing mindsets and limit adaptability. Certification programs prioritize profit over innovative thinking, but they can also force people to think deeply about the material, leading to new ideas. Experience counts more than training, but some certifications require practical experience. They may advance agile thinking, but this doesn't prove that they don't limit adaptability.
