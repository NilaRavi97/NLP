Humans make decisions based on both emotions and rationality, with emotions initially influencing our reactions. However, we also consider long-term consequences through a rational lens. It's a battle between rationality and emotionalism, where emotions can win out in some cases. Humans are capable of rational thought, but this doesn't mean emotions don't play a significant role in decision-making.
