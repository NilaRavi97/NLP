The debate surrounding transgender athletes in sports centers on whether they should compete in their identified gender's division or be separated by weight or ability. Proponents argue that transgender athletes should not be discriminated against and that athletics should be separated by weight or ability, not gender or sex. Opponents believe that transgender athletes who have undergone male puberty possess an unfair advantage over biological females. A fair solution requires careful consideration of all arguments and factors involved. (90 words)
