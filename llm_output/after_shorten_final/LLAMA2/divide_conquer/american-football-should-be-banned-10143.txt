Here's a condensed version of the summary that adheres to the 90-word limit:

The NFL faces criticism for its handling of player safety and long-term health effects, with calls for a ban or informed consent. The league has a history of racism and doesn't support players financially. Regulation may be necessary to ensure fairness and transparency. While other sports are more dangerous, American football's cultural phenomenon makes it unique in terms of harm potential. Risk-taking behaviors shouldn't be discouraged, but regulation is necessary to ensure player safety.
