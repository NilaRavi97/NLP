The International Olympic Committee is debating a permanent venue for the Olympics. Some argue it would ensure optimal conditions, while others believe it would give the host country an unfair advantage. An alternative proposal suggests permanent venues in different parts of the world, ensuring fairness and sportsmanship. Concerns about unequal travel time for athletes have been raised. A permanent venue could still embody the international factor by having different countries decorate facilities or organize events. Hosting the Games is often seen as a symbol of societal advancement, but it has also been associated with authoritarian regimes and human rights violations. A permanent venue would not necessarily solve these issues, but alternating countries taking charge of organization could promote fairness and sportsmanship. The ultimate goal is to bring athletes together, not showcase countries' spending power.
