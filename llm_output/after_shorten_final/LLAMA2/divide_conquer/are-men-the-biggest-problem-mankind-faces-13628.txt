In this debate, participants discuss men's role in societal problems and their responsibility in addressing gender roles and institutionalized sexism. While some argue that cultural transformation is necessary, others emphasize the role women play in shaping men's behavior. The debate highlights the complexity of gender roles and the need for a nuanced understanding of their impact on society. It is wrong to attribute society's ills to all men, as each individual is unique and not all men possess the flaws often associated with them. However, as the historically dominant gender, men have played a significant role in creating society and its problems. A cultural shift is necessary before change can prevail. Teaching children respect for all humans, regardless of gender, is not dependent on academic education but rather personal values.
