Societal norms and individual variations shape gender differences; men tend to take risky jobs, while women have longer life expectancy and higher educational attainment. The gender education gap may be due to societal issues rather than differences in academic potential. Women's fertility declines earlier than men's, but they can still have children via in vitro fertilization. Women have achieved great physical feats, such as extreme endurance races and space exploration, but their weightlifting records are inferior to men's. These achievements suggest that women are equal to men, not better.
