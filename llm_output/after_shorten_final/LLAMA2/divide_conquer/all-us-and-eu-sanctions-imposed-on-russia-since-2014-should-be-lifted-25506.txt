The debate over sanctions on Russia has created a complex situation for both the US and EU, with negative economic consequences for Europe. Lifting sanctions could escalate the conflict in Ukraine, while continuing them may lead to authoritarianism. A balance between economic and political interests is required. Effective enforcement of the Minsk Agreements is crucial to stopping the fighting and death in Ukraine. Increasing the West's presence in Ukraine and supporting the Ukrainian Navy can help counteract Russia's maritime dominance and deter further aggression. However, there is strong opposition against Ukraine joining NATO. The Russian government has large domestic support for its foreign policy, and lifting sanctions won't make a difference. Putin's approval rating has been high, but support for his foreign policy is falling due to increased support by voters to fix domestic issues.
