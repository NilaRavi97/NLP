The debate on pre-marital sex and purity culture emphasizes comprehensive sexual health education and open communication. While some advocate for waiting until marriage, others believe sexual experiences are essential for personal growth. Purity culture can perpetuate harmful ideas about sex and women's self-worth, leading to feelings of guilt and shame. People should have the freedom to make their own choices about their sexual health without fear of judgment or condemnation. Research suggests casual sex can have positive effects on mental and physical health, but these benefits can also be attained through an active sex life within a marriage. Purity pledges can reduce the spreading of STIs, but abstinence is the only way to completely avoid STIs.
