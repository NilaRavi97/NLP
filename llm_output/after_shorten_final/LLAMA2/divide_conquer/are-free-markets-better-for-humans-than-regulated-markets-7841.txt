The debate between free markets and regulation centers on balancing economic freedom with social welfare. While companies may prioritize sustainability, they may struggle to compete with those that don't. Certification agencies can provide transparency, but must avoid abuse and overly restrictive regulations. Consumers can drive improvements through purchasing choices, but explicit regulation can ensure uniform standards and address urgent issues like climate change. However, consumers may not demand environmentally responsible action, and even when they do, it's not clear what it means. Reporting on environmental impact may result in greenwashing. In a deregulated market, information is restricted, making it difficult for consumers to make informed choices. Certification agencies can help address this issue by providing transparency and ensuring trustworthiness. Regulated markets allow for benefiting those in need, while deregulation can create economic barriers to social mobility. A regulated market is considered better at meeting needs than a free market as it ensures more equal access to services such as healthcare, food, and housing. Free markets introduce their own form of chaos, as biases allow for sub-optimal outcomes in a free-market such as nepotism, racism, classism, and misogyny. Market regulation is not about curbing its ability to be "free" in terms of flexibility to adjust to consumers' needs, but to find a midpoint between what market participants want and potential dangers outside of the market's domain. Regulated markets are more likely to create laws against newer and better ideas/products that create competition so as to protect the interests of an already existing business. Innovation in free markets is geared to business profits, and do not necessarily benefit the population. Free markets are more likely to promote innovation that correlates with the financial benefits of corporate CEOs. Businesses cannot make profits without offering some benefit to people, but they may offer benefits to few people while negative externalities impact the rest of society. Public bodies and nationalized industries are monopolies in and of themselves, meaning the government creates monopolies. However, the government being a monopoly does not support the claim that only the government creates monopolies. Historically, monopolies have been more common under a free market.
