Here's a 90-word summary of the debate:

Mechanics and manufacturers disagree on how to burn off carbon buildup in cars. Running the engine at high revs is suggested, but manufacturers recommend regular oil changes and proper driving habits. A safer alternative is running the engine at 3000 rpm, which doesn't apply to diesel engines. Driving fast is illegal and dangerous, but it's applicable to diesel engines with DPF due to higher exhaust gas temperatures that burn off soot caught in the DPF.
