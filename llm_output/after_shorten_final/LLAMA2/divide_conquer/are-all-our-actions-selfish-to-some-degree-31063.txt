People can act selflessly and selfishly, with mixed motives. Altruism has an evolutionary advantage, but our sense of self colors all actions with a degree of selfishness. Cooperation is contagious and norms influence behavior. In some societies, people conform to avoid punishment, while in others, cultural norms are internalized, leading to less rebellious behavior.
