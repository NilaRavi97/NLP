The UK government accuses Russia of being "highly likely" responsible for the Skripal poisoning case, leading to the expulsion of Russian diplomats. Other countries show solidarity with the UK, opposing Putin's alleged attempt to divide the West. The UK has evidence of Russia stockpiling deadly nerve agents, but some argue that punishing before proving is a political farce. Trump and other leaders did not mention the case when talking with Putin, possibly provoking Russia and increasing tensions.
