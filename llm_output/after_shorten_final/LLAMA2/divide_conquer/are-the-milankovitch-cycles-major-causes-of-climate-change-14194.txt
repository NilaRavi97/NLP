The debate over the primary cause of climate change continues, with some attributing it to natural Milankovitch cycles and others citing human activities. While the sun does influence climate, manmade climate change is occurring at a much faster rate than natural changes, with potentially accelerating warming in the near future. However, the impact of cycles on climate change is not well understood, and satellite data raises doubts about solar irradiance measurements. TSI stands for Total Solar Irradiance, which is the best measurement currently available, but its accuracy is unclear.
