The government is considering a proposal to provide financial support to primary caregivers until their child enters school or another form of care. The aim is to address low population growth, recognize the value of child-raising, and support low-income families. Concerns include potential government interference in parenting and people having children for the wrong reasons. The proposal aims to offset some of the costs of raising children but not make childrearing profitable.
