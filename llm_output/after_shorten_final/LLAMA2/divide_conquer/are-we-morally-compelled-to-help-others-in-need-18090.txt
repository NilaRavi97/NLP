Here's a 90-word summary of the debate:

People debate whether assisting others is a moral must. Some say it's vital for successful societies and may be a long-term investment. Others argue that morality is personal, and there's no universal duty to sacrifice for others. Altruism is distinct from utilitarianism and less likely to justify harmful actions. Not helping others is seen as wrong, indicating a moral obligation to assist.
