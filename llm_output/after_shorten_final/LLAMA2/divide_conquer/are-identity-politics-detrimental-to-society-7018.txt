The debate on identity politics sparks discussion on balancing individual liberty and addressing systemic injustices. While it can unite marginalized groups, it can also create divisions and reinforce power dynamics. Organizing for change is important, but choosing leaders based on demographics rather than character and ideas threatens democracy. Factionalism along ideological lines can lead to better policies, but factionalism on demographic lines can result in bad policies. Identity politics can promote votebanks, which hinder societal progress by promoting political stagnation and apathy toward cooperation.
