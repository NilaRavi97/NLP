The debate on anarchism centers around the tension between individual freedom and societal needs. While some argue that a lack of government may lead to control by a hostile governing body, others believe that anarchic societies can be ethical. It's important to note that individuals should have the right to reject interventions that affect them, as being subject to another person's decisions negates this right. An anarchist system can be stable and organized through horizontal structures, allowing society to self-regulate.
