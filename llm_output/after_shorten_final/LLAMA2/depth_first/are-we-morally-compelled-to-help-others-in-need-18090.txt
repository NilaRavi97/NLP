Here's a summary of the debate in 90 words or less:

People have a moral obligation to assist others in need, regardless of historical successes or failures. Altruism is distinct from utilitarianism, and helping others may be seen as a long-term investment, create social incentives, and build a protective network. While there may be costs, we are not obligated to sacrifice our lives for another. Duty is independent of personal gain, and logic alone cannot provide moral imperatives.
