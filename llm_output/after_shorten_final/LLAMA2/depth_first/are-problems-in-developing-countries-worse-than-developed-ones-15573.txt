The claim that problems in developed countries are not comparable to those in developing countries is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. Developed countries have stronger institutions, better infrastructure, and more resources to address social and economic issues, while developing countries face structural challenges that hinder their ability to solve problems effectively. Global issues like climate change and economic inequality affect both developed and developing countries, but the impact is often more severe in the latter. Developed countries have greater negotiating power and influence on the global stage, which can impact the way problems are addressed. Basic needs are not always met in developing countries, which can perpetuate poverty and limit opportunities for social mobility. It is essential to work towards creating a more equitable world where everyone has access to basic necessities and opportunities for social mobility.
