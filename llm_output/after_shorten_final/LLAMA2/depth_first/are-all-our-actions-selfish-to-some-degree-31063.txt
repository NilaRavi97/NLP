Here's a 90-word summary of the debate:

It's argued that all human actions are selfish, as people act in their own interests. Selfless acts can still be driven by personal gain, like feeling good or avoiding guilt. However, people may also act with genuine concern for others. Self-preservation is a fundamental drive, but empathy and rational thought can overcome it. Religious beliefs and cultural norms can influence behavior, leading people to act in ways that appear selfless. Ultimately, the distinction between selfish and selfless actions can be blurry, and individuals must reflect on their motivations and values.
