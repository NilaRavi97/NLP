Here's a 90-word summary of the debate surrounding exorbitant transfer fees in football:

The debate raises ethical concerns about fairness, player wages, and club investment. Some argue that removing fees would increase player wages and reduce financial risks for clubs. Others believe that fees are necessary for compensating clubs for their investment in player development. The argument against transfer fees suggests they can lead to corruption, inflate players' egos, and pressure players to perform. Proponents argue that transfer fees are a fair market transaction and make football more exciting. The ethical implications depend on how fees are used and regulated within the industry.
