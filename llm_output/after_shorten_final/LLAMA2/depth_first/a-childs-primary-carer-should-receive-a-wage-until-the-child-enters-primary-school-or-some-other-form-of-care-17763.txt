Here's a 90-word summary of the debate:

The proposal to provide a wage to primary carers until their child enters school or other care has both supporters and detractors. Supporters argue that it could help low-income families, address population decline, and recognize the value of child rearing. Detractors worry that it could encourage lazy parents, cheapen the parental experience, and be economically unsustainable. While the wage would offset some costs, it wouldn't make childrearing profitable. The feasibility of this measure is questioned, but proponents argue that the investment would generate economic activity and pay for itself.
