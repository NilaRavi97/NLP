Here is a revised summary that adheres to the 90-word limit:

Bars of soap are a better choice than shower gel due to their convenience, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. Soap is easier to use and generates less waste, making it more accessible for those who struggle with dexterity or strength. Additionally, bars of soap last longer than shower gel and don't sting eyes, making them a practical solution for an eco-friendly shower routine.
