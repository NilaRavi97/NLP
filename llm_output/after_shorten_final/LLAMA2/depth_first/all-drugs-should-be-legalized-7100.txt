Here's a 90-word summary of the debate on drug legalization:

Drug legalization is a contentious issue, with proponents arguing it would reduce crime and boost public safety, while opponents believe it would increase drug use and harm society. Legalizing drugs would allow for government control over production, distribution, and sale, reducing drug-related health problems and criminal activity. It would also generate revenue for public health initiatives and promote responsible consumption. However, opponents argue that legalization would lead to increased drug use and abuse, particularly among young people. Ultimately, the decision to legalize drugs depends on a careful consideration of both sides of the argument.
