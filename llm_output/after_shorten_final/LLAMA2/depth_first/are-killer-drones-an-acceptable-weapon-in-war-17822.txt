The debate over "killer drones" in warfare revolves around their effectiveness, affordability, and ethical implications. Proponents argue that drones provide an effective deterrence weapon that minimizes harm to future generations and allows for precise targeting, reducing collateral damage and civilian casualties. Critics argue that the use of drones increases fatalities, reduces accountability, and could lead to a global drone arms race. They also suggest that drones are a poor way to combat terrorism as they replace attempts to capture individual leaders and allow for new terrorist recruitment. Additionally, some cultures view the use of drones as cowardly. The ethical implications of drone warfare, including potential civilian casualties and psychological trauma experienced by drone pilots, are also a concern.
