Here is a summary of the debate in 90 words:

It's not accurate to say that one gender is better than the other. Men and women have unique strengths, weaknesses, and contributions. Physical strength and endurance differ between genders, but women excel in marathons and triathlons. Women tend to score higher on emotional intelligence tests and have made strides in education and career advancement. They also take risks in entrepreneurship and investing. While men engage in riskier behaviors like reckless driving, women live longer on average. Both genders have different reproductive health and fertility, and they are represented differently in extreme sports and space exploration. It's important to recognize and appreciate these differences rather than comparing or hierarchizing them.
