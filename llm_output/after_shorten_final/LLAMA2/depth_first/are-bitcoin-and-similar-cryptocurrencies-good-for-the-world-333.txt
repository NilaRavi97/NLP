The debate on using cryptocurrencies for activism, whistleblowing, and investigative journalism revolves around anonymity and accessibility versus risks of illicit activities, volatility, and environmental impact. Cryptocurrencies offer anonymity and ease of transfer, but are vulnerable to money laundering and illegal activities. Their value can fluctuate rapidly, making it difficult to rely on them as a stable source of funding. Governments can restrict access to exchanges and infrastructure, and mining some cryptocurrencies has a significant environmental impact. The decision to use cryptocurrencies should be carefully considered, weighing pros and cons and considering alternative methods of funding and support.
