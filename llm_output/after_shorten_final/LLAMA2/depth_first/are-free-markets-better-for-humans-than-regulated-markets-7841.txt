Here's a summary of the debate on whether a free market or regulated market is better, strictly adhering to the given information and staying within the 90-word limit:

Free Market: Promotes competition, innovation, and efficiency, allocating resources effectively. Encourages decentralized resource allocation and incentivizes companies to be productive. Allows natural competition to arise and level out monopolies.

Regulated Market: Ensures equal access to services, prevents unethical practices, and protects citizens from exploitation. Allows government intervention to promote competition and legislate fair prices. May create complacency in companies' efforts to improve environmental and social impact.

Both markets have advantages and disadvantages, and a balanced approach may be possible. The decision depends on one's values and priorities.
