Here is a summary of the debate over teaching coding in schools in 90 words:

Teaching coding in schools has both advocates and opponents. Supporters argue that it develops problem-solving skills, improves logical thinking, enhances creativity, prepares children for the digital future, fosters collaboration, builds confidence, and provides a competitive advantage. However, critics argue that not all children are interested, it requires specialized teachers, needs up-to-date resources, focuses on tool usage rather than problem-solving, can be time-consuming, has limited demand, and industry professionals are better suited to teach. Additionally, some argue that self-learning is possible and that the investment in teaching coding could be better spent on other subjects.
