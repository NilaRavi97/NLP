Here is a summary of the debate about Canada's new impaired driving laws regarding cannabis in 90 words or less:

Canada's new laws making it a criminal offense to drive under the influence of cannabis are appropriate and don't require major revisions. It was already illegal to drive high before, and the added laws just make it a criminal offense with a 5-year jail sentence. Stricter regulations are necessary to ensure road safety, even if they are different from alcohol laws. Occasional users may be too impaired to drive after smoking something too strong, while frequent users could be fined or imprisoned due to build-up in their system, even if they are completely sober.
