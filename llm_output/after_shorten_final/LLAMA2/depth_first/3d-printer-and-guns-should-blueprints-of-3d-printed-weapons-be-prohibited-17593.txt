The debate over publishing blueprints for 3D-printed firearms centers on public safety and censorship. Proponents argue that the availability of these blueprints could lead to untraceable, undetectable, and unstoppable firearms, posing a significant risk to society. Opponents argue that banning the publication of blueprints is an infringement on freedom of speech and that regulating these files would be pointless since they can be recreated independently. The opposition to 3D guns is based on the Undetectable Firearms Act, which prohibits the manufacture, sale, or possession of firearms that are not detectable by metal detectors or x-ray machines. The ATF has successfully fired multiple lethal rounds with 3D guns and special ammunition has been designed to prevent their explosion. The debate continues, but the availability of blueprints for 3D-printed firearms raises significant concerns about public safety and potential misuse.
