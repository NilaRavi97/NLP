A debate surrounding the implementation of a flat tax system is currently underway. Proponents argue that this system would provide fairness and certainty to all taxpayers, as well as simplify the tax code and redirect energy towards more productive work. Opponents, on the other hand, point out the difficulties in implementing such a system, including accurately valuing all assets for every individual, and the potential negative impact on those who rely on them for income. Additionally, they argue that the idea may be met with resistance from wealthy individuals and those who benefit from the current system, and that it would undermine the principle of liberty.
