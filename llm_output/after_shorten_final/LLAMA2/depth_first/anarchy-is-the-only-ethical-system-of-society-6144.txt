Here is a summary of the debate on anarchism in 90 words:

Proponents of anarchism argue that people can coexist peacefully without a leader, citing examples of successful anarchist societies. They also argue that the concept of anarchy rejects the hierarchical structure of the modern-day state and that most human relationships are voluntary. On the other hand, opponents argue that humans have a history of violence, morality is not objective, and anarchy can lead to uncertainty and conflict. Both sides highlight the complexity of the issue and the need to consider multiple perspectives when evaluating the ethical implications of anarchism.
