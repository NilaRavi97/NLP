Here's a summary of the debate in 90 words:
Milankovitch cycles contribute to climate change but can't fully explain the recent rapid temperature increase. The Sun's impact varies over time, with a small effect over solar cycles and a larger effect over millions of years. Other factors must be considered as the primary cause of climate change. Measuring the Sun's radiative output (TSI) is currently the best method available, but it may not be reliable, and further scientific evidence is required to establish a definitive correlation.
