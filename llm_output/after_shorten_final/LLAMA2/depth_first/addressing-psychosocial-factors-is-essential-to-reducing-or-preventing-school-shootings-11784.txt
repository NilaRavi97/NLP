To prevent school shootings, it's crucial to address psychosocial factors, such as trauma, abuse, depression, and personality disorder, as they are a key cause of mass shootings. 80% of perpetrators had been socially excluded and were seen as outcasts, and over three-quarters had threatened or attempted suicide. Addressing these factors can help identify individuals at risk and prevent such crimes. However, it's important to note that mental illness alone does not cause violence, and other factors must be considered.
