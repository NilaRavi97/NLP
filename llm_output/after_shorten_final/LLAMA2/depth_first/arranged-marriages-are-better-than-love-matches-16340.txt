Here's a summary of the debate in 90 words:

Arranged marriages and love marriages have pros and cons. Arranged marriages offer stability, practicality, family involvement, social validation, and a lower divorce rate. However, they may lack emotional connection, force marriage, and limit choice. Love marriages are based on personal choice, emotional connection, happiness, better communication, and realistic expectations. But they can be unstable, create unrealistic expectations, and lead to disagreements. Both types of marriages require compromise and effort to succeed.
