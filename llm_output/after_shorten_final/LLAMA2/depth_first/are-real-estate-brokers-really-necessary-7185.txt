Here's a 90-word summary of the debate:

The role of real estate brokers is debated, with some arguing their services are unnecessary and can be replaced by technology. Brokers act as middlemen, but their commission fees are considered excessive. Bad practices in the industry, such as dual representation and value manipulation, could be addressed through legislation and regulation, making brokers obsolete. Technology could automate services, creating new markets with multiple competitors, but implementation may burden government resources. The question remains: are real estate brokers necessary in the home buying process?
