The debate about gender and sex highlights their complex relationship. While some equate the two, others argue they're distinct. Gender's a social construct shaped by culture and history; sex is biological. Recognizing the difference is crucial for addressing challenges faced by transgender and non-binary individuals and avoiding further marginalization. Combining the concepts could erode progress, while respecting differences allows for independent development based on scientific research and social understandings.
