The debate over privatizing Air Traffic Control (ATC) centers around safety and efficiency concerns. Opponents argue that private companies may prioritize profit over safety, leading to higher costs and potentially dangerous decisions. Proponents point to successful privatization in other countries, such as Canada, and argue that private companies can innovate and modernize the system more quickly than the government. However, critics counter that privatization would divert funds from other modernization priorities and that planning and execution would take decades. The decision will depend on weighing potential benefits against risks and complexities.
