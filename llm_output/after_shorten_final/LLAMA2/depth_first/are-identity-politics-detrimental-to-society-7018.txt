Here is a summary of the debate around identity politics in 90 words or less:

The role of identity politics in society is debated. Some see it as a means to advocate for marginalized groups, while others criticize it for creating divisions and oversimplifying complex issues. It can be seen as a form of humanism, but it can also create tension that hinders the process of achieving equal rights. Critics argue that it is incompatible with democracy and can promote votebanks, but a balance between identity politics and universal humanism may be necessary to achieve true equality and justice for all individuals.
