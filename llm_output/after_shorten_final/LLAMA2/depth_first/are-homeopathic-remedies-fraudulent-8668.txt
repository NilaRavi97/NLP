Homeopathic remedies lack scientific evidence, considered fraudulent by many. Placebos have shown positive effects in rare cases, but most studies indicate homeopathy doesn't work. Preparations are often highly diluted, making it unlikely that active substance remains. Proponents claim higher dilutions produce stronger effects, but medical science shows the opposite. Oscillococcinum, a widely marketed anti-flu preparation, references air bubbles from a poorly prepared slide. A large Australian study found no reliable evidence supporting homeopathy's effectiveness. Prescribing homeopathic remedies to those with life-threatening illnesses when other effective treatments are available can be considered fraudulent and even murderous.
