Humans are driven by emotions and rationality, but emotions play a larger role in shaping our decisions and actions. While societies act rationally, individuals are influenced by their emotional responses. Emotional factors sway our decisions, and thought experiments show that humans are subjective to emotional rhetoric. Advertising manipulates emotions to influence choices, and scientific breakthroughs were made possible by rational thought. Our self-consciousness is a result of both emotional and rational processes.
