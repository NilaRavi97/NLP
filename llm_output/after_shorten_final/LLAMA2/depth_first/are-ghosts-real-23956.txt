The debate about ghosts continues, with some people claiming they exist and others saying there's no scientific evidence. Believers cite personal experiences and cultural beliefs, while skeptics argue that these claims are unreliable and influenced by factors like mental illness, hallucinations, and the desire for popularity. Some say video evidence is not convincing and can be manipulated or staged. Others suggest ghosts could be a manifestation of energy left behind by intense events, but there's no conclusive evidence to support this theory. The debate remains inconclusive, with no definitive proof from either side.
