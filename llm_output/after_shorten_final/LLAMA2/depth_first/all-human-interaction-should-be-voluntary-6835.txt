A voluntary society based on the non-aggression principle (NAP) would promote peaceful interactions and respect for individual rights. The NAP would apply to criminal justice, contracts, and property rights. Private defense agencies or community-based justice systems would replace coercive taxation-funded police forces. Civil courts ad honorem would settle disputes and enforce contractual obligations. Property rights would be protected through private arbitration services or community-based mediation. The government's role would be limited to enforcing the NAP, resulting in a small, unobtrusive government. While there are challenges in implementing such a system, it has the potential to create a more ethical and just society.
