The debate over sanctions on Russia continues, with both sides presenting valid arguments. Sanctions can punish Russia for violating international law, deter aggressive behavior, and promote human rights. However, they may be ineffective, harm innocent parties, and fail to address root causes. Some experts argue that sanctions have backfired in the past, making target countries more aggressive. Sustaining the sanction regime may be necessary for the US and EU to defend their democratic systems, but it's crucial to find a solution that balances national interests, international law, and human rights while avoiding actions that may escalate tensions further.
