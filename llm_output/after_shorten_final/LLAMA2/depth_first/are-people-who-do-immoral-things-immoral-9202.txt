Here's a 90-word summary of the debate:

The debate centers on whether people who do immoral things are inherently immoral or can change. Some argue that people can develop their sense of morals and ethics over time, making it foolish to label someone as immoral based on one stage of their life. Others believe that labeling someone as immoral can lead to negative consequences like anger, shame, violence, and suicide. They also argue that correctional facilities aim to rehabilitate prisoners, but there's no reliable way to connect imprisonment with the permanent status of immorality. Ultimately, committing immoral actions doesn't necessarily mean someone is irreversibly immoral.
