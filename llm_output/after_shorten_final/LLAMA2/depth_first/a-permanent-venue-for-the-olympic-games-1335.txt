The proposal for a permanent venue for the Olympic Games has sparked debate. Proponents argue that it would promote the Olympic spirit and create a symbol of international unity, while opponents claim it would be expensive, unfairly favor certain countries, and undermine the principle of rotation among host cities. A permanent venue could provide continuity and stability, but it could also create an uneven playing field for athletes and undermine the principle of fairness and equality. It could also reduce the symbolic value of the Games by eliminating the opportunity for host countries to showcase their unique culture and traditions. Instead of a permanent venue, I suggest that the IOC continue to rotate the host city among interested countries, promoting fairness, equality, and international cooperation.
