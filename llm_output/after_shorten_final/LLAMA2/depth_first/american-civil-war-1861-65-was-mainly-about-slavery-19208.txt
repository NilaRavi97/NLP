The American Civil War (1861-1865) was a complex conflict with multiple causes, including slavery, states' rights, and economic disagreements between the North and South. The seceding states cited slavery, self-determination, and economic interests as reasons for succession. Attacks against slavery were a primary grievance, but tariffs and industrialization also played a role. Some Northern states still allowed slavery after the war's end, and President Lincoln revoked emancipation proclamations issued by generals during the war. The eventual emancipation of slaves in the South was used as a political and military strategy, not an end goal. Economic reasons and issues against central authority were also significant factors.
