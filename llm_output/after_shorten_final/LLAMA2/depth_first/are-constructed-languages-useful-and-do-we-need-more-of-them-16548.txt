Here's a 90-word summary of the debate on constructed languages:

Constructed languages like Klingon and Dothraki have their own grammar and vocabulary, but their practicality is disputed. While some see them as helpful for bridging communication gaps, others view them as impractical and unlikely to replace established languages. Chomsky argues that humans are born with innate grammar knowledge, making it difficult to create a new language. However, some people believe constructed languages can be useful for simplifying international communication and can be learned through apps like Duolingo. Despite this, most constructed languages fail to gain significant use and are often seen as a creative exercise rather than a practical tool.
