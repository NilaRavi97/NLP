Here is a summary of the debate in 90 words:

The debate over whether humans are inherently good or evil is complex and multifaceted. Arguments for good include humans' natural capacity for empathy, desire for love, and ability to love others. Arguments for evil include the existence of sadists, humans' capacity for harmful actions, and the subjective nature of "evil." The fact that humans can exhibit both kindness and cruelty suggests that our actions are shaped by various factors, including upbringing, experiences, and cultural influences. Ultimately, it's important to recognize that humans are capable of both good and evil, and that our actions are often a result of a complex interplay of factors.
