The debate on human nature's inherent goodness or evilness features perspectives highlighting human-caused suffering and selfishness, countered by arguments for empathy and altruism. Some claim evil is innate, citing harm caused by self-interest, while others argue evil is a social construct shaped by environmental and psychological factors. Qualities like psychopathy are not universal, implying evil is not a general human trait. Additionally, actions deemed evil may stem from survival instincts or ignorance. Opinions are split, with 'evil' considered a subjective, culturally influenced concept.
