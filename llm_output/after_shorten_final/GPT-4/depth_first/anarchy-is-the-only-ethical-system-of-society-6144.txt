During the debate, anarchy advocates argued that it's ethically superior, emphasizing voluntary association, individual freedom, and a natural inclination towards ethical behavior without government intervention. Critics countered that anarchy could incite violence, create power imbalances, and fails to ensure rights and justice, contending that governments are essential for justice, national defense, and protecting the weak. They also noted that while anarchy might function in small communities, it's impractical for larger societies due to potential instability and the challenge of managing cooperative ventures and environmental concerns.
