The debate examines whether we have a moral duty to help others, contrasting the views that altruism is natural, beneficial, and morally endorsed, against the argument that it can harm the individual and has been used to justify historical atrocities. Skeptics challenge altruism when it lacks personal benefit. The conversation explores themes of morality, consequentialism, and whether the duty to help is dependent on the outcomes, indicating a complex interpretation of what constitutes 'right' action.
