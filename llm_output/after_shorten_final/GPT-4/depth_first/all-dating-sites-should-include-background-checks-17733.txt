Advocates for mandatory background checks on dating sites argue it would increase safety, filter undesirable individuals, and could lead to more marriages. They suggest paid sites should require checks while free ones offer them optionally. Critics counter that implementing checks could compromise data security given sites' dubious cybersecurity histories, inflate costs, and deter users, leading to a drop in membership and revenue. They worry about the balance between user safety and privacy. The debate juxtaposes enhancing user protection against potential privacy and financial implications.
