The debate on crop circles involves two sides: one skeptical of extraterrestrial origin, citing human confessions of creation and a lack of proof for alien existence or involvement. The other side points to the complex patterns and peculiar physical traits of some crop circles as evidence of non-human creation and hints at indirect extraterrestrial communication. Skeptics challenge the assumption of alien technology influencing crop circle formation, arguing that current understanding does not support such claims.
