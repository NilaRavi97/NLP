The debate on identity politics is polarized. Critics say it creates societal divisions, perpetuates victimhood, and detracts from individual merit and broader global issues, impeding democratic dialogue. They indicate it oversimplifies complexities. Supporters defend it as a redress for systemic inequalities and historical discrimination, advocating for marginalized groups and highlighting ignored communities. They argue it's crucial for self-advocacy and societal progress. The debate also examines the intersection with critical theory.
