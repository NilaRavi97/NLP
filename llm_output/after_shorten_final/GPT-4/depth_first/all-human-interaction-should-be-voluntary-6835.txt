Proponents of a voluntarism-based society, adhering to the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP), argue it would respect free will, reduce government oppression, empower minorities, and potentially lower crime, with voluntary courts resolving disputes. Critics counter that not all interactions can be voluntary, pointing to taxes and social obligations, and question the enforcement of laws, protection of minorities, and practicality of voluntarism for all society segments. They raise concerns about addressing pollution, corruption, foreign threats, and infrastructure development without taxation or central governance.
