The debate on sex and gender is polarized, with some conflating them due to linguistic practices, as seen in German, and others advocating their distinction. Proponents of differentiation cite the unique experiences of transgender and nonbinary people and argue for the acknowledgment of diverse gender identities. They warn against the simplification of these issues, concerned it could hinder the recognition and rights of marginalized groups. Critics contend blending the two could silence smaller, disadvantaged communities.
