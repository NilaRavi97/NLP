The debate on ghosts' existence is divided. Skeptics cite the lack of scientific proof and possible psychological origins for sightings, noting that personal stories may be influenced by mental illness or a desire for fame. They also point out the absence of a clear ghost definition and the potential for natural explanations still unknown to science. Believers reference cultural beliefs and unexplained occurrences. They argue that ghosts in entertainment don't invalidate their existence, though video evidence is often untrustworthy. Mainstream religions' stance on ghosts varies, adding complexity to the debate.
