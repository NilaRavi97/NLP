Proponents of coding in schools claim it fosters problem-solving skills necessary for the digital age, could integrate with existing subjects, potentially close the gender gap in tech, and prepare kids for the future workforce. They suggest coding can be taught through play. Critics, however, argue that coding adds to an already full curriculum, detracting from childhood joys and primary literacy efforts. They question coding's relevance to all occupations and its long-term utility, citing rapid tech changes and diverse professional paths.
