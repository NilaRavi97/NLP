During the debate, consensus emerged that while Milankovitch Cycles contribute to long-term climate changes, they cannot explain the swift warming recently observed. Solar changes were deemed a minor factor, with data since the 1970s not aligning with temperature increases. The primary driver was recognized as human-induced CO2 emissions. Skepticism remained over the exact impact of Milankovitch Cycles, and concerns were raised about the adequacy of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) as a measure, underscoring a need for more solid scientific proof.
