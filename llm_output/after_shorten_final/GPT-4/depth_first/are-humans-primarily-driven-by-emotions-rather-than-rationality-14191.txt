The debate argues whether humans are guided by emotions or reason. Supporters of rationality point to orderly societal actions in economics and politics. Opponents highlight emotional biases manifest in market irregularities and war. Although government systems seem rational, personal choices, demonstrated by scenarios like the trolley problem, are often emotional. Populism further proves emotion's role in persuasion. Conversely, advancements in science and self-awareness underscore rational thinking. These contrasts suggest a complex relationship between emotional and rational influences in human actions.
