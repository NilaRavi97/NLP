Agile certifications are a contentious topic, with some arguing they provide a structured learning path for newcomers and deepen understanding through study and reflection. Others claim certifications are profit-driven, promote rote learning over true understanding, and lock practitioners into specific methodologies. Additionally, while certifications may show dedication to learning, they do not necessarily reflect practical experience or seriousness about the Agile craft. The value of certifications in advancing Agile thinking is thus debated, with experience often rated higher than theoretical training.
