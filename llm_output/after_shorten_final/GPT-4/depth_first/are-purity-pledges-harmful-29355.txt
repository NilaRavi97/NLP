Debate over purity pledges, vows to abstain from premarital sex, rages on. Advocates claim they counter societal hypersexualization, empowering individuals, especially women, to manage their sexuality. Opponents argue they reinforce harmful norms and wrongly tie self-worth to virginity, leading to shame and reduced sexual autonomy. Critics say these uninformed pledges contribute to stigma, misinformation on sexuality and contraceptives, and may increase risks of unprotected sex and sexual violence. Although abstinence prevents some health issues, pledges are seen as largely ineffective, failing to promote a broad understanding of sexual health and education.
