In a debate on banning 3D-printed gun blueprints online, advocates of the ban highlight the potential for untraceable, undetectable guns to bypass regulations, posing a security risk. Opponents counter, invoking the First Amendment, and argue that blueprints don't equate to immediate threats. They note the technical skill needed for 3D printing guns and that constructing guns for personal use is already lawful, viewing 3D printing as merely an alternative means to legally create firearms.
