The debate discusses transgender athletes' participation in sports. Supporters suggest that male-to-female athletes who haven't undergone male puberty could compete with women or alternative criteria like ability could be used, also highlighting the risk of bullying if transgender children are excluded. Opponents point to biological advantages retained by transgender females, such as bone structure and muscle mass, and argue for strict biological standards. They claim testosterone levels don't negate these benefits and emphasize preserving competitive fairness over individual preferences.
