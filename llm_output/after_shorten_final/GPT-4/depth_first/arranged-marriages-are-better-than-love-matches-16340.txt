Arranged marriages are debated for their merits and drawbacks. Advocates claim they're as viable as love matches, promoting shared values and stability. Critics counter with concerns about abuse and infringement on personal choice, commonplace in countries where such unions prevail. They champion personal choice and the role of love and compatibility in marriages. The debate contrasts the stability and cultural continuity of arranged marriages with the autonomy and emotional connections inherent in love marriages.
