The debate centers around whether men are mainly responsible for societal problems. One perspective acknowledges men's role in issues but argues their necessity in vital services, potentially due to inherent gender traits. The opposing view attributes gendered roles to institutional sexism and biological diversities. Acknowledging menâ€™s physicality and propensity for risk, it's argued that systemic problems and individual variance shouldn't be ignored when considering power imbalances. Education, cultural influences, and religion's evolution are debated as potential factors for change. The conversation underlines the complexity of gender relations, suggesting no single-gender is to blame.
