The debate explores if immoral acts define one as inherently immoral and if individuals can change. Opponents argue morality is subjective and changeable; therefore, labeling someone permanently immoral is unjust. Others assert that immoral actions make one immoral but concede the possibility of reform, acknowledging evolving morality. Concerns are raised about the negative societal impacts of branding persons as immoral, including possible increased suicide or mental health decline. The role and effectiveness of prisons in addressing immorality are disputed, alongside questions on whether lack of self-control or ignorance justify immoral actions and if struggling to act morally exempts one from moral scrutiny.
