Proponents of killer drones argue they protect soldiers, are precise, cost-effective, and deter terrorists. Critics counter that they increase fatalities, may spark conflicts and an arms race, and leave less technologically advanced nations vulnerable. Operators could suffer psychological harm, and the ethical concern of distancing soldiers from the battlefield is raised. They also argue drones may increase civilian casualties and hinder interrogation opportunities. Some believe that tech advancements in warfare can lead to human rights progress.
