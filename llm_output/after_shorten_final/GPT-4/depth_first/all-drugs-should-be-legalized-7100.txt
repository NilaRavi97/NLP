The debate on drug legalization covers policy legitimacy, human rights, cultural practices, research, and harm reduction. Advocates claim that legalization could curb violence and advance research, respecting freedom of choice. Critics fear it could increase drug use and abuse, harming minors and vulnerable groups. They suggest it might shift profits from cartels to corporates, exploiting users. Regulation may enhance drug safety and education could foster responsible use. Portugal's example shows potential benefits but societal and youth protection concerns persist.
