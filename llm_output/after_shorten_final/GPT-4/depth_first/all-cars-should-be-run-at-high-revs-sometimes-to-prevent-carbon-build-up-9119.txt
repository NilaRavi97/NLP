To prevent carbon buildup, some advocates recommend high-rev driving for its high-temperature cleansing effects, with backing from certain mechanics and car manuals, like VW Passat's, for DPF maintenance. Critics argue it poses safety risks, with potential for fatal outcomes, and can damage vehicles. They point out modern cars usually avoid carbon buildup, suggesting better maintenance alternatives exist. There's also disagreement on whether this method benefits both gasoline and diesel engines.
