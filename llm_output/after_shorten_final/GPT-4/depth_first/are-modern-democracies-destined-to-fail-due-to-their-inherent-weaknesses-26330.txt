Debate surrounds democracy's efficacy, with strengths in adaptability and freedom but criticism for being slow and tied to wealth. Democracies vary, evolving with time; some integrate non-democratic elements for stability. While less than half of nations are "free," rich democracies often succeed in balancing the rule of law with civil liberties. Challenges include unfair practices, populism, and uninformed voters. Education and technology are viewed as tools to harness collective wisdom. Despite its flaws, democracy's self-correcting nature maintains its status as a preferred governance system, capable of preventing strife through electoral change.
