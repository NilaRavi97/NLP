The debate centers on an "Asset Tax" replacing all other taxes, which may alter investment behavior and potentially destabilize markets. Critics cite the unfair burden on low-income inheritors of illiquid assets and the difficulty of assessing asset values. Proponents claim it is fairer than income-based taxation and could streamline the tax code. Concerns include the effects on low-yield investments and the erosion of tax incentives. Some view compulsory taxation as theft, while others foresee efficiency gains. The proposal faces political hurdles, mainly from wealthier individuals resistant to change.
