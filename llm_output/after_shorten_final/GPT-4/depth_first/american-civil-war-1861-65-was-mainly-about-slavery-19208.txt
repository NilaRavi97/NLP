The debate centered on the cause of the American Civil War. One side claimed it was to preserve the Union, with some Union states keeping slavery, while the other emphasized Southern states naming slavery as the secession's cause. Economic issues and congressional power struggles also played roles, but slavery's expansion was crucial. Cultural divides and states' rights added complexity. Lincoln's wartime decisions, such as reversing generals' emancipation proclamations, suggest emancipation was also used strategically.
