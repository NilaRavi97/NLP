The debate over Russian sanctions, in place since 2014, weighs their effectiveness. Supporters see them as necessary to pressure Russia's government and punish oligarchs allied with Putin, while critics argue they hurt civilians and bolster Putin's domestic image without changing Russian politics. Sanctions have economically impacted the US and EU, yet also pushed Russia to adapt, such as reducing military expenditures. There's disagreement on whether lifting sanctions would promote peace or whether maintaining them upholds global norms and aids Ukraine against Russian assertiveness.
