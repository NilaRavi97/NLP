The debate on school shootings examines psychosocial factors against gun control. One side claims gun control can't entirely prevent access to weapons; the other stresses addressing the issues like trauma and mental illness in potential shooters. Studies show shooters often face social exclusion or exhibit suicidal tendencies, yet mental illness isn't strongly linked to mass shootings. The complexity of motives, including negative social experiences and mental health, is recognized. Research into both areas is needed for prevention. Care must be taken not to stigmatize the mentally ill when tackling these factors.
