Proponents of a permanent Olympic venue suggest it could circumvent the negative impact on different host countries, diminish distractions, and provide athletes with consistent conditions, referencing problems like Beijing's pollution and Rio's heat. They argue it would reduce corruption and overspending in the bidding and construction phases. Critics, however, believe it would favor one country, diminish cultural exposure, and could create an expensive, underutilized facility. They propose alternate revenue streams and say issues can be tackled without dismissing the tradition of global host rotation, floating ideas of continent-based rotations or a neutral site such as Greece, while considering associated costs and risks.
