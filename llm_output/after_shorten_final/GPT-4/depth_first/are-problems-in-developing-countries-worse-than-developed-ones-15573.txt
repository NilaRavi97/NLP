Developing countries grapple with poverty, emergency vulnerability, and weak state support, compounded by debt and economic isolation despite receiving aid. While their citizens work hard, benefits from developed nations are often seen as investments. They inherit problems like gentrification and unhealthy lifestyles from developed countries, on top of colonial legacies, debt, and corruption. Climate change hits them harder due to fewer resources, making their issues more severe because of these internal and external pressures alongside worldwide challenges.
