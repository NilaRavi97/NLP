The debate centers on whether real estate brokers remain necessary with technology's rise. Advocates claim brokers' market expertise and staging skills justify their fees. Opponents argue technology allows independent transactions without excessive broker fees and that reliance on brokers is outdated, potentially causing conflicts of interest. There's a discussion on high-value transactions needing professionals versus possible brokerage reforms or replacement by new technologies and services. The core issue is whether the traditional model's value is worth the cost or if innovation should overhaul or eliminate the model.
