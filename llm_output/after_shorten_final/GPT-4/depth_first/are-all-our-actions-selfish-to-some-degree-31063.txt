The debate focuses on whether human actions are inherently selfish. Proponents argue that self-preservation and personal desires suggest underlying selfishness, citing examples like lifeguards and parenting. They suggest even self-sacrifice has selfish motives. Opponents believe in true altruism, pointing to selfless sacrifices and charity. They argue that some actions, while seemingly altruistic, may be motivated by empathy or social conformity. The discussion recognizes selfishness as a possible evolutionary trait but also acknowledges cultural and rational capacities for fostering altruism.
