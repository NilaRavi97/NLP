The debate discussed Canada's new cannabis-impaired driving laws. Advocates support stringent rules to maintain road safety, comparing them with alcohol regulations and recognizing differences in effects. Critics argue the laws could unjustly penalize sober drivers due to the variance in THC levels and are skeptical about accurately gauging intoxication levels. Examples from Colorado's lenient approach and Australia's tighter regulations are cited to illustrate the challenge of balancing wrongful punishment risks with public safety. Agreement exists that intoxicants hinder judgment, yet opinions diverge on the appropriate legal standards for cannabis impairment.
