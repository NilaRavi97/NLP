Democracies are criticized for being resistant to change, centralization of power, and inequalities, but they are also lauded for promoting equality and freedom. Even though they're prone to manipulation and favoring majorities, they have self-corrective mechanisms and uphold the rule of law. Despite the risks posed by technology and socio-economic changes, democracies can adapt through elections, embody civil society-driven governance, and have historically evolved to meet societal demands, indicating their potential for resilience and iteration.
