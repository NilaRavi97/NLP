The debate examines the idea of all human interactions being voluntary. Advocates believe it would honor autonomy, benefit marginalized groups, and align with free will, considering a non-aggressive legal system. However, critics argue it's impractical, might ignore minority needs, and question the enforcement of taxes and citizenship. They also worry about maintaining law and order, essential involuntary interactions for development, government intervention in market failures, and the feasibility of a wholly voluntary society.
