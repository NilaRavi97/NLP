The debate over drug legalisation involves government authority, public health, societal effects, cultural values, and policy consistency. Proponents suggest it could reduce violence, bolster research, respect autonomy, and protect cultural practices. Opponents worry about higher youth usage, public health crises, social inequities, and possible rises in crime. The discourse addresses misunderstandings of drug types, mental health impacts, prohibition efficacy, criminalization's harm on marginalized groups, and potential economic gains from regulated markets.
