The debate examines if all human actions are selfish, suggesting survival instinct makes us inherently self-interested, even in altruistic acts due to personal gains or legacy concerns. Counterarguments cite examples like self-sacrifice, while rebuttals point to avoidance of guilt or genetic continuation motives. Some say cultural norms and promised rewards influence supposedly selfless actions. Others mention self-destructive actions, neither selfish nor altruistic. Overall, motivations appear complex, with human behavior existing on a spectrum between selfishness and selflessness.
