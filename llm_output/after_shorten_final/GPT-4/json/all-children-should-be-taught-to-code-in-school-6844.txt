The debate on coding in schools is complex. Advocates cite its importance in developing cognitive abilities, bridging gender gaps, and preparing students for a digitalized world and STEM careers. Others worry it may burden curricula, strain teachers, and question its necessity due to online resources and changing job markets. Suggestions include that coding can be learnt through play, mitigating concerns about suitability for children and excessive screen exposure.
