The debate compares the severity of problems between developing and developed worlds. Proponents argue developing countries face harsher issues like extreme poverty, weak social systems, and poor governance, often tied to historical factors like colonialism. Critics counter that developed nations also experience significant problems such as minority distress and gentrification, noting that challenges like climate change affect both. Interconnectivity of global issues implies that problems in one area affect another. There are concerns about the developed world imposing solutions, potentially exploiting rather than helping developing nations.
