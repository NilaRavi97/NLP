Proponents of "Humans are evil" argue that human violence, selfishness, and enjoyment of violence in media reveal our evil nature. Opponents counter that evil is a social construct, not innate, pointing to innate empathy and altruism in humans, including children. They claim that culture and upbringing shape our actions, not nature. They also assert that notions of good and evil are culturally relative and judgments are necessary for justice, implying that evil isn't inherent but shaped by perspectives and experiences.
