Proponents of new constructed languages cite benefits in tech interaction, language design creativity, and adding to linguistic knowledge, referencing programming languages and auxiliary languages like Dothraki. Opponents argue for enhancing existing languages instead, the practicality of translation apps, and the brain's possible adverse effects. They note the impracticality and historical failure in widespread adoption of artificial languages, despite their feasibility, considering the extinction of many natural languages.
