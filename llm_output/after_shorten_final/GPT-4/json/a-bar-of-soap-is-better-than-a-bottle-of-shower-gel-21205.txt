The debate compares bar soap and shower gel. Soap advocates cite its cost-effectiveness, longevity, minimal packaging, and environmental benefits. Critics raise shared soap hygiene issues, including hair residue, eye irritation, and its old-fashioned image. Supporters rebut that non-stinging soaps are available and that it can efficiently wash short hair, while acknowledging gels may also irritate eyes. They argue that despite the inconvenience of dropping soap, its advantages prevail.
