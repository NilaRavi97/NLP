The debate examines if humans act based on emotions or rationality. Pro-rationality arguments cite macroeconomic policies as evidence of society's rational behavior, contrasting emotional reactions, like war responses after 9/11. Critics argue that rationality can be subjective and that post-hoc rationalization is common. Emotions' influence is shown in moral dilemmas and political populism, yet rationality is credited for scientific advances and the development of self-awareness, suggesting a nuanced relationship between emotional impulses and rational thinking.
