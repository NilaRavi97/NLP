The debate graph discusses whether psychosocial factors should be prioritized in preventing school shootings. Advocates claim that even with gun control, shooters could access weapons illegally. They highlight the role of social exclusion and suicide threats. Opponents counter that these factors don't always predict violence and caution against detracting from gun control efforts or stigmatizing mental illness. Despite conflicting views, more research is urged to identify reliable risk indicators for such shootings.
