The debate on a flat "Asset Tax" is contentious. Critics fear it could destabilize investment, trigger a recession, and be unfair to low-income asset inheritors, calling it inflexible and equating compulsory taxation with theft. They worry about the difficulty of asset valuation and the impact on low-yield assets. Proponents argue for its fairness, simplicity, and potential to equalize taxation on all income types, believing it ensures equal treatment. They contend it provides certainty, but critics question its effect on wealth distribution and individual liberty, yet concede adaptability is possible.
