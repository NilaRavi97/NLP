The ethics of exorbitant transfer fees in football are debated. Supporters argue that absent transfer fees, player wages would increase, that they support the related industry, benefit poorer clubs, compensate for player development, and are justified by market economics. However, opponents claim they encourage fiscal irresponsibility in clubs, could lead to inflated ticket prices, invite corruption, enable rewards without merit, cause pressure on players, and dehumanize individuals by putting a price on them. Some suggest the excitement of transfer discussions enriches the sport.
