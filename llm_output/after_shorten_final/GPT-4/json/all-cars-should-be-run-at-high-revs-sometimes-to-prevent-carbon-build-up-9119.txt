The debate is about the merit of running cars at high RPMs to prevent carbon buildup. Proponents assert high RPMs burn off carbon and mechanics recommend it. Opponents raise safety concerns, potential damage to modern cars, and the existence of better alternatives. Some argue it's unnecessary, citing vehicle manuals, like the VW Passat's, which suggest regular RPM ranges for diesel engines with DPF. Advocates for high RPMs counter that it benefits diesel engines, where higher temperatures help burn off soot in the DPF.
