Proponents of "Killer Drones" argue they deter conflicts and minimize long-term harm, leveraging technological superiority and valuing human life. They contend drones restrict terrorist activities. Critics, however, worry about increased casualties due to lower accountability and a potential global arms race. They criticize the perception of drones as cowardly, the ethical concerns likened to video game behavior, and the loss of intelligence that could be gathered from captured terrorists. Additionally, critics question the assumed superiority of high-tech warfare and caution against letting cultural biases hinder military innovation.
