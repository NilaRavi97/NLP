The debate contrasts perspectives on whether immoral acts define personal immorality. One side argues that immorality isn't permanent; morality is subjective, can change, and labeling people as immoral can cause harm. The other asserts that persistent criminal behaviors suggest fundamental immorality, not all feel remorse, and some can't discern right from wrong, implying inherent immorality. Recidivism and incarceration's role in assessing morality are also discussed.
