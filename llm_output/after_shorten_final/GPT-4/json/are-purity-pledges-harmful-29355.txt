The debate on purity pledges centers on their societal impact. Advocates claim they counteract promiscuity, offering support and empowering individuals to manage their sexuality while potentially reducing teen pregnancies and STDs. Opponents argue they perpetuate harmful stereotypes, shame around sex, and place undue pressure on victims of sexual misconduct. Questions arise about their psychological effects and reinforcement of patriarchal views. Critics also highlight the ineffectiveness of pledges, with many eventually breaking them, challenging the role of abstinence pledges in sexual health and personal autonomy.
