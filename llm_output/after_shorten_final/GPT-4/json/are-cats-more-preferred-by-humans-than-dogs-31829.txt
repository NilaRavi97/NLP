The debate graph compares cats and dogs on human preference. Proponents for cats highlight their low maintenance, citing less need for food, walks, and self-cleaning habits. Studies suggest that cats are cheaper initially than dogs. Conversely, dog enthusiasts argue dogs form stronger bonds with humans through interactive play and responsiveness to cues. Preferences are subjective; cats' independence suggests intelligence, while dogs' long domestication and brain structure imply better companionship. Cats are deemed cleaner; however, dogs are praised for loyalty and emotional connection. Ownership statistics reveal both cats' popularity and dogs' widespread presence.
