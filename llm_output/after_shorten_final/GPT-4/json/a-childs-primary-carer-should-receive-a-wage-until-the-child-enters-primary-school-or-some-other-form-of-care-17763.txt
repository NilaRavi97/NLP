The proposal to pay primary carers a government wage until their child goes to school is contentious. Critics worry about government overreach and suggest an unconditional wage to avoid it. Some argue child-rearing doesn't warrant societal support, while others say it aids equality for low-income families. There's concern it could incentivize having children for money or be economically unsustainable, but supporters point to successful examples like Germany's program, claiming it could boost the economy. They believe child-rearing deserves recognition as valuable work, though some contend compensation should come from the private sector, not government subsidies.
