The debate assesses whether real estate brokers are necessary. Critics argue technology could allow individuals to bypass brokers, possibly leading to a dominant platform for transactions. Proponents cite brokers' expertise in high-stakes deals and value-addition. Detractors question the justification of commissions and broker efficiency, hinting at possible monopolies with automated platforms. Meanwhile, supporters defend brokers' matchmaking and valuation roles, despite claims that informed sellers could independently manage sales and that reforms could eventually render brokers obsolete.
