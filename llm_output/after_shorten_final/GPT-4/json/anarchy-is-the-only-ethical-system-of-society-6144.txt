Proponents of anarchy argue it's ethical as it promotes freedom without government coercion, respecting voluntary interactions and liberty. Critics argue that some coercion is necessary for social order and to protect the vulnerable, suggesting anarchy could lead to abuse and instability. Debates also question anarchy's ability to address societal challenges like economic externalities and national defense, with advocates suggesting voluntary norms can foster responsibility. Skeptics doubt the practicality of anarchy, pointing to historical failures and the necessity of some government functions, questioning its ethicality and sustainability.
