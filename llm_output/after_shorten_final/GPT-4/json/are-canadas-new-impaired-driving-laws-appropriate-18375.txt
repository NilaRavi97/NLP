The debate revolves around the strictness of Canada's new cannabis-related impaired driving laws. Critics highlight potential issues with THC accumulation in regular users causing sober individuals to be charged, unreliable testing for intoxication levels, and the need for more nuanced limits reflecting individual tolerance. Proponents contend that firm laws deter impaired driving, comparing cannabis to alcohol in requiring standardized legal thresholds. They argue stringent regulations are essential for safety, even as opponents stress the unique properties of cannabis relative to alcohol and call for more personalized impairment measures.
