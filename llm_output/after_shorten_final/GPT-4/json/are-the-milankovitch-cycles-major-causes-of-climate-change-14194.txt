Debaters contest if Milankovitch Cycles primarily drive climate change. Critics note these cycles don't fully explain modern rapid warming, challenging the role of TSI and argue human factors play a larger role. While acknowledging the cycles' role in past ice ages, they point to other influences and the lack of evidence for a new ice age, opposing the observed warming. Proponents argue the cycles align with historical climate patterns, despite disputes over their exact impact. The debate reflects contrasting views on natural versus anthropogenic climate drivers.
