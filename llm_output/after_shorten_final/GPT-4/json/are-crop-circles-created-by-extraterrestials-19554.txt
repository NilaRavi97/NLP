The debate on crop circles being of extraterrestrial origin involves various viewpoints. Skeptics argue that advanced aliens would likely use direct communication, not ambiguous signs, and point to human confessions of creating them. Proponents cite their complexity and unusual phenomena at sites as evidence of alien activity. However, critics assert the absence of solid proof and believe the designs hold no specific message. The controversy is ongoing, with skepticism often opposing the idea of extraterrestrial messages through crop circles.
