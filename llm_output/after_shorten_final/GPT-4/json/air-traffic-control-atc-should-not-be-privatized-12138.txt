The debate on ATC privatization hinges on safety and efficiency. Critics warn that private ATC may compromise safety for profit, leading to increased costs and potentially risking advancements in ATC technology. Proponents argue privatization is backed by airlines and controllers, citing Canada's success, and insist that safety remains a priority. Yet, the US's leadership in ATC and the public funding model's century-long efficacy raise doubts about the need for privatization, with concerns that it may impose high costs and disrupt technology upgrades while potentially providing unequal services.
