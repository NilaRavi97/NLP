Proponents of arranged marriages claim they foster stability and family involvement, with potential for love to grow over time, and point out lower divorce rates. Critics argue they can lack initial love, risk family interference, uphold outdated norms, and infringe on personal choice, possibly concealing forced marriages. While studies praise love's importance in marriages of mutual choice, the success of a marriage is subjective, making it debatable whether arranged or love marriages are superior.
