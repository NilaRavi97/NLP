The debate on 3D-printed gun blueprints online is polarizing. Advocates see sharing plans as a right and argue that laws still govern the use of such guns, while acknowledging technical barriers to creating functional weapons. Critics fear these guns are untraceable and could bypass safety measures, leading to widespread access, including by those prohibited from gun ownership. They contend regulation can mitigate, though not entirely prevent, these issues.
