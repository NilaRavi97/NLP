Homeopathy is criticized for its scientifically improbable high dilutions, which often leave no active ingredient, yet claim effectiveness. Critics say marketing placebos as real medicine is unethical and dangerous for serious diseases. Defenders cite the placebo effect, but opponents argue treatments should rely on statistical efficacy. Legally, informed consent is key, but critics demand transparency about homeopathy's scientific inadequacy. The prevailing view is that homeopathy, at odds with established medical practice, constitutes fraud.
