The debate is on trans athletes in men's divisions. Some argue they retain male advantages like testosterone levels, suggesting pre-puberty transitioners could compete with women. Others propose non-gendered categorization by weight or skill, emphasizing inclusivity and discrimination. There's advocacy for competing by gender identity, considering bullying and personal choice, while opponents prioritize biological sex for fairness in sports.
