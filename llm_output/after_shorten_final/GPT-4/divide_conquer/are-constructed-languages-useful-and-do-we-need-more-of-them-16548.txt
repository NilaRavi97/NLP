The debate on conlangs contrasts their creativity and artistic contributions with concerns about practicality and cognitive effects. Proponents emphasize their potential to enrich linguistic understanding and artistic expression, exemplified by fictional languages such as Klingon and Dothraki. Opponents argue for the sufficiency of natural languages and advances in translation tech, citing the decline of constructed-language-influenced Sanskrit. Others view language evolution as a social construct, referencing Chomsky's theories. Despite skepticism over widespread use, conlangs maintain significance through their unique grammars and specialized uses.
