The debate examines whether emotions or rationality principally guide human behavior. Advocates for emotions highlight their decisive role and vulnerability to populism. In contrast, rationalists emphasize rationality's role in progress and point to the Phillips curve. The post-9/11 response exemplifies a blend of both. Despite rationality's acclaim in science, emotional influences, as seen in the trolley problem and emotion-driven advertising, seem prevalent. Although rational thinking and self-awareness are recognized, emotions are often considered the dominant force in human behavior.
