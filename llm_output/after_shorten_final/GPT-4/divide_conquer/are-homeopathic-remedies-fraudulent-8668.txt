The debate on homeopathy is contentious. Critics call it ineffective and unscientific, citing risks when used for serious conditions. Supporters point to anecdotal evidence and the placebo effect. A major Australian review showed no solid proof of its efficacy, blaming faulty research methods. Despite scientific skepticism, homeopathy remains popular based on personal stories. Critics argue the prescription of homeopathy for life-threatening conditions is unethical when effective treatments exist, while some suggest it as a last resort when conventional medicine fails.
