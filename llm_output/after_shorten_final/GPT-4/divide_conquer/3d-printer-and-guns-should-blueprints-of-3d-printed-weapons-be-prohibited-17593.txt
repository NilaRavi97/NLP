The debate over banning 3D-printed gun blueprints is a clash between public safety and free speech. Supporters assert that the ban would limit untraceable firearms, while detractors argue it infringes on free speech. The ban's effectiveness is questioned, with some noting its similarity to the failure of stopping online piracy. Although restricting access might be feasible, the ban could be bypassed by those with technical skills. Moreover, the creation of functional firearms from CAD files necessitates specialized knowledge, suggesting that widespread production is not imminent without proper expertise.
