The debate compares abstinence-only with comprehensive sex education, criticizing the former for its negative psychological impact and links to purity culture, which may promote victim-blaming. Comprehensive education is argued to prioritize safety and health, as opposed to abstinence pledges associated with higher pregnancy and STD rates. A study is mentioned that shows similar HPV rates among women who took purity pledges and those who did not, questioning the success of abstinence pledges. Additionally, it's noted that while 12% of teenagers pledge to abstain until marriage, only 3% fulfill this pledge.
