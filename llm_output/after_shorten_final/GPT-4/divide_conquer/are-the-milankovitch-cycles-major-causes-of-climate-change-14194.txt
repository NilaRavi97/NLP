The debate centers on whether Milankovitch Cycles or human activity drive present-day climate change. Despite historical climate shifts caused by natural cycles, the rapid changes and satellite data point to human-induced CO2 emissions as the main cause. This human impact has reportedly diverted the climate from its expected natural cooling trend. The debate acknowledges difficulties in measuring solar energy (TSI) and limits in scientific certainty about the precise causes of climate change, yet leans toward human actions as the primary factor over solar variations.
