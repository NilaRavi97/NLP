In a debate on ghosts, believers cite personal experiences and some quantum physics theories, while skeptics call for empirical evidence and cite psychological or cultural explanations. Skeptics debunk eyewitness accounts and paranormal videos as unreliable or manipulated. Historical figures like Houdini have challenged paranormal claims without proof. TV shows like "Ghost Adventures" promote alleged ghostly encounters, yet are often regarded as fictional or technologically fabricated. Mainstream religions generally dismiss ghosts as superstitions, but this isn't definitive since not all phenomena are recognized by religious doctrines.
