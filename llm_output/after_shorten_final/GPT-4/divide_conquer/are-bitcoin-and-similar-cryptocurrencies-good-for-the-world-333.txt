The debate on cryptocurrency centers around privacy benefits versus concerns including volatility, environmental effects, and criminal use. Germany's recent policy to limit crypto anonymity sparks privacy concerns, with implications for discreet sectors like sex work, but is justified by the need to prevent crimes like human trafficking. Critics argue traditional payment methods already balance privacy and safety, while proponents note that privacy in transactions, particularly for stigmatized but not immoral activities (e.g., menstrual products, mental health, sexual activities), is crucial, despite societal taboos.
