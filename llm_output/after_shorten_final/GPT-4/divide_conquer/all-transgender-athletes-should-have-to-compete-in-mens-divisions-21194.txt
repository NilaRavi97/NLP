The debate on transgender athletes in sports balances inclusivity and fairness. Proponents argue for rights and against discrimination, advocating for transgender women's participation in women's events. Opponents cite advantages from male puberty and propose hormone regulations or separate categories. Views differ on physical performance factorsâ€”whether to prioritize biological differences or hormonal impacts. International guidelines highlight testosterone levels as a competitive edge; however, concerns remain over permanent anatomical differences like bone structure. The discussions continue on how to balance these factors within athletic rules.
