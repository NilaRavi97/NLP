The debate on paying primary caregivers hinges on recognizing their unpaid work and possibly boosting birth rates, against concerns of high costs and exploitation via childbearing for profit. Proposals for unconditional support meet hesitancy over influencing reproduction. Discussions highlight caregiving's undervalued history and its societal importance, particularly in nations facing population decline. Some argue for love over money as the basis for having children, though financial aid could help with childrearing expenses. Germany's parental allowance is cited, with arguments that this investment might promote economic growth through increased spending.
