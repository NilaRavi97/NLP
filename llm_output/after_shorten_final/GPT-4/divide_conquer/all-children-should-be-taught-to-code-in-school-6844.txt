The debate on coding in education pits its benefits for job readiness and STEM engagement against curricular and tech challenges. Critics advocate for broader problem-solving skills. In the UK, while funding support grows, resources and qualified teacher shortages remain obstacles. Partnerships with industry and educational apps offer solutions, yet lower education salaries discourage tech experts from entering teaching. The notion that self-taught coders can master skills online faces skepticism, with the argument that children especially need guided instruction to grasp foundational coding concepts.
