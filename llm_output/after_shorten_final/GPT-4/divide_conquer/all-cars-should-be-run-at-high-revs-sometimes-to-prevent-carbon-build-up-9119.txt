Supporters of "Italian tuning" advocate for high RPM revving to remove carbon deposits, with some mechanics in agreement. Critics, however, warn of possible damage, arguing modern cars are less prone to buildup and recommend other maintenance practices while pointing out the lack of such guidance in manuals. Although less pertinent for certain diesel engines, such as VW Passat 2.0 TDI, that clear carbon at lower RPMs, those with a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) need higher temperatures for soot removal. Safety concerns also arise due to the potential for high-speed driving accidents and fatalities.
