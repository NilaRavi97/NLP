The debate analyzed the merits of free versus regulated markets, weighing consumer freedom and innovation against inequality and environmental impacts. Proponents of free markets highlighted their advantages, while critics cited disparities and historic monopolies such as the US Gilded Age. Pro-regulation advocates favored service and monopoly control, with detractors warning of reduced competition and entrenchment of big firms. An agreement emerged on seeking a compromise to maintain both public welfare and a dynamic economy, recognizing that monopolies can form independently of government influence.
