The debate examines whether human behavior is motivated by self-interest or altruism, discussing various perspectives such as evolutionary theory, rational choice, empathy, cultural influences, and religion's role. It questions the genuineness of charitable acts, with some arguing that even seemingly selfless deeds are ultimately selfish, seeking rewards or social conformity. Studies, including Harvard's public-goods games, show altruism can proliferate via social norms. There's a consideration of internalized cultural values that may override the desire to rebel, making the distinction between self-interest and altruism complex.
