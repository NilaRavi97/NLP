During the debate on the moral obligation to help others, proponents argue it fosters cooperative societies and adheres to ethical norms, potentially yielding positive outcomes like karma. Opponents contend morality is subjective and self-interest or exploitation may result from altruism. The Saemaul Undong movement is cited as successful collective cooperation. The debate contrasts logical and ethical truths, with the former potentially informing moral decisions. Critics' claims that altruism can lead to atrocities are met with the argument that it's the failure to assist effectively, rather than the absence of a moral duty to help.
