Advocates for mandatory background checks on dating sites argue that they enhance safety and aid in finding suitable matches while deterring criminals. They feel especially paid sites should offer such checks. In contrast, opponents raise concerns about data security due to cyberattack risks and favor optional background checks to prevent potential membership fee increases and revenue loss for dating platforms. They believe unpaid dating services should maintain a user-beware model without compulsory safety measures, noting that mandatory checks may deter users from joining.
