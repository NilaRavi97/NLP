The debate on identity politics is polarized. Proponents view it as a means to redress past injustices and foster equality, while critics argue it causes division, weakens democracy, and perpetuates a sense of victimhood. There are also concerns that it overshadows merit, encourages narrow voting based on communal lines, and could harm societal progress and mutual understanding. Critics further suggest that identity politics may slow secularization and reinforce the political status quo by creating vote banks that promote social apathy and hinder inter-community cooperation.
