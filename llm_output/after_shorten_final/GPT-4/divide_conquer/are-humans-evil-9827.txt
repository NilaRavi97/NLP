The debate questioned if morality is inherent or created by society. Points discussed included evolution's impact, societal influence, and personal choices. Topics ranged from moral responses in high-stress situations, mental health effects, and innate empathy, to responses to real vs. fictional violence and the subjectivity of "evil." The participants noted the broad disapproval of some acts, the perspective-dependent nature of morality, and the role of judgment in justice. They also examined the belief that fear is vital for moral reasoning and the misunderstood notion about psychopaths and fear.
