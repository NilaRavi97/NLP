Canada's debate on cannabis-impaired driving laws pitches advocates for stringent measures against critics who find the laws excessively strict. Advocates want cannabis laws on par with alcohol due to safety concerns, while critics argue THC blood limits are not a reliable intoxication measure and oppose equating cannabis directly with alcohol. The key issue is achieving a balance between road safety and fair impairment assessments, with critics cautioning against relying on individuals' self-assessment of their fitness to drive while under the influence.
