In the debate on Agile certifications, critics claim they prioritize profit over deep understanding and practical skills, potentially stifling innovation. Proponents counter that certifications offer structured learning and validate commitment and basic knowledge, beneficial to newcomers. Detractors acknowledge some certificates merely test memorization, but supporters argue they showcase professional dedication and serve as a starting point for hands-on experience, which is vital for Agile mastery. Critics and advocates agree, however, that certifications are not the ultimate measure of Agile expertise but can be a useful step in grasping the basics.
