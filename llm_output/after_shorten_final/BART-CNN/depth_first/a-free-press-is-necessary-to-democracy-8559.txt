Voters require reasonably complete and accurate information about the actions of politicians in order to hold them properly to account. Exposing corruption reduces the incidence of corruption or causes it to go deeper underground. A free press consists of publications that keep each other in check, thereby unveiling and sanctioning the publication of false or misleading information. The freedom to say and write anything true is a fundamental value of democracies. A robust democracy requires mechanisms to reinforce democratic forms and their effectiveness.
