Sanctions to Russia have cut growth in Europe by 0.3 percent of GDP in 2015. Continuing sanctions on Russia will cost Europe over 90 billion euros in export revenue and more thantwo million jobs over the next few years. To truly hurt Russia's economy, it would be necessary to heavily sanction their energy sector. San sanctions only inflict further suffering on Russian citizens, without deterring the Russian state. Sanctions make Russia more aggressive; peace in the international community would best be achieved by reconciling with Russia to benefit from collective bargaining power.
