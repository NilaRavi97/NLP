Gender can refer to either social roles based on the sex of the person (gender role) or personal identification of one's own gender based on an internal awareness (gender identity) Gender is recognised as a concept that varies depending on the history and culture of the society in which one lives. The ways in which genders are expressed has changed over time and from place to place. Our culture and norms shape the way in which gender is expressed.
