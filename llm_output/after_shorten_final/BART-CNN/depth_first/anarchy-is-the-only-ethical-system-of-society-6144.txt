Anarchy is the only ethical system of society. Coercion is always unethical and governments are by nature coercive. Maximized individual liberty is most ethical. Government is itself a strong tyrant that only the very elite are protected from. Under anarchy, disputes erupt into violence and people align themselves with the powerful for protection (think Tribal or Clan Warfare). Right's are not obeyed because of coercion (like in a state system) but because they are culturally accepted.
