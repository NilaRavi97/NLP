If transfer fees didn't exist players would receive higher wages. Poorer clubs benefit when they sell players on for fees. Transfer fees enable rewards without merit. Agents who have had no part in player development become rich with minimal contribution. Costs are passed on to ordinary supporters, meaning not everybody can afford to enjoy the sport live. The transfer fee is compensation for ending a contract early; factors affecting the fee include how long the contract had left to run. Putting a monetary price on humans is unethical.
