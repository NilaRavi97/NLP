People who do immoral things aren't immoral. People have the capacity and will to change after doing bad deeds. Ignorance is not a valid excuse when making moral decisions. People who do bad things ought to be locked up in jail. Not all bad things deserve punishment by imprisonment. Believing that people are immoral leads to tons of anger, shame, violence, and suicide. People cut off ties with their friends if they consider their friends to be immoral.
