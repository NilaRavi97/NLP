Addressing psychosocial factors is essential to preventing school shootings. Many American school children suffer from psychossocial issues (trauma, abuse, depression, etc) but do not commit mass shootings. Addressing these factors contributes to the stigma of the mentally ill being violent. It is patently incorrect to blame school shootings on mental health issues; it is, at best, one part of a complex of issues. A person might be more apt to commit a school shooting if they are currently, or have previously, experienced abuse, rejection, bullying and/or mental illness.
