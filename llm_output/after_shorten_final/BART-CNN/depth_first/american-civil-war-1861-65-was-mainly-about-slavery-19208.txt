The Civil War was mainly caused by disputes between the North and South regarding their differing economic values. The Key Issue was not just slavery but the Asset/Economic Rights of both States and of Men. There was a lot more Economic Reasons and issues against central authority with slavery regarded as more of an economic factor rather than a moral one. Tensions were already accumulating as a result of the Tariff of 1828. Combined with calls for African American equality from the North, this threatened the slavery-based agrarian lifestyle in the South and caused states to secede.
