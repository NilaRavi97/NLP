Technology has provided buyers with enough tools and information to complete the purchase of a property by themselves. For landlords/ladies real estate brokers provide experience to judge which tenants are trustworthy. The industry is filled with incompetent people who don't have the proper education or training to be an agent. Some practices used by brokers are outdated and/or may be dishonest. The 3-5% commission over the selling price of the property is excessive. Proper legislation from governments could provide the means to create services that would render brokers obsolete.
