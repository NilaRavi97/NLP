Very high rpms produce high temperatures which burns off built up carbon. The user manual for my VW Passat 2.0 TDI diesel recommends regularly driving at between 2000-3500rpm for extended periods. This does not apply to diesel engines with DPF because the higher exhaust gas temperatures help to burn off soot caught in the DPF. There are mich better methods, this one only makes a slight difference and isn't worth the trouble. It works just as well at 3000 rpm.
