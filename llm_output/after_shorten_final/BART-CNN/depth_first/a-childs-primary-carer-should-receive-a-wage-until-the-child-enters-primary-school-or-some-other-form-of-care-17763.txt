A child's primary carer should receive a wage from the government until the child enters primary school or some other form of care. The government may interfere more in parenting practices if the parent essentially becomes an employee. Such a measure may solve the challenge of low population growth confronting many nations. In Germany, parents receive an allowance for each child already. This is feasible. Money spent on this policy will generate economic activity as recipients spend it on goods and services, helping it to pay for itself.
