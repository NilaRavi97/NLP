There is no scientific proof that ghosts are real. Personal anecdote is not a reliable form of evidence. Hysteria does not make something real. Belief is not evidence. Observed reality could very well be made up for anyone. Seeing ghosts or shadows can be a sign of psychosis. Attributing a strange phenomenon to being a ghost simply because we cannot explain it any other way does not mean it is absolutely a ghost. This is a logical fallacy called 'an argument from ignorance'
