Public policy (which is forged through regulation, among other things) precedes any functioning market. We cannot know what humans need or want 'a priori' so a regulated market is doomed in principle. Deregulation causes economic barriers to social mobility by reducing social assistance for housing or education. Free markets operate on profitability and profitability alone. A company doesn't care what race or sex an employee is so long as they're more productive than the people they didn't hire. Regulated markets are more likely to create laws against newer and better ideas/products.
