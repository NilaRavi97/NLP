The IRS classifies Bitcoins as an investment, rather than a currency. Most ordinary citizens would not use such a currency anyway. Citizens have no control over whether their information is stored securely. Phishing affects cryptocurrency services just as much as traditional banking. Most cryptocurrencies are traceable by design, and not fully anonymous. Currencies not backed by governments are harmful. If the cryptocurrency is too widely adopted in a nation then the government won't get enough in taxes to maintain society's infrastructure.
