Voting serves as a "release valve" for citizens to express their dissent. Democracy can potentially leverage the "wisdom of the crowd" in a way that other systems cannot. Democracy served its purpose as the best political system for the socio-economic conditions. As those change, so it becomes unable to meet the needs of those who hold power. There exists, before power if withdrawn from the masses, an opportunity for the masses to seize power.
