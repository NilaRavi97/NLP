A utopian Communist Government is more ethical than an anarchic society. Maximized individual liberty is most ethical. Many people get hurt in anarchy that wouldn't get hurt under a stable government. Utilitarian communism is unworkable unless the vast majority of the population are ideologically committed to the virtues of industry and thrift. All forms of communism are unethical unless voluntary (e.g. anarcho-syndicalism, which is still anarchic)
