Real estate agents played a part in the US housing bubble of 2007, among banks and mortgage underwriters. For landlords/ladies real estate brokers provide experience to judge which tenants are trustworthy. Technological substitutes for real-estate brokerage would not abolish brokerage, but actually transfer the real estate brokerage role to a single monopoly entity. It is unlikely that the potential increase in sale price would sufficiently offset the commission paid to a broker. In the long run, a monopoly by Zillow will probably prove more exploitative than many brokers.
