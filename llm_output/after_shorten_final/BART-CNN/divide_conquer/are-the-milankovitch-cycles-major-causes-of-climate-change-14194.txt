We warm the Earth in 100 years as it naturally happens in 41000 years. Anthropogenic climate change is much faster. Several reports suggest that manmade warming could even accelerate in the next 10 years. The Milankovitch Cycles are major causes of climate change. It is recognised that the cycles caused the present Quaternary ice age to start. Geologically we are on the way into a new ice age but temperatures are increasing; so are taking the opposite direction.
