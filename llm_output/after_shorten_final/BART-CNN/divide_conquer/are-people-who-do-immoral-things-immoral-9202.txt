The perception of someone as continually and irreversibly immoral precludes the possibility of their change past a certain point life. Believing that people are immoral leads to tons of anger, shame, violence, and suicide. Populations that are deemed immoral commit suicide at a higher rate than other non-stigmatized populations. People cut off ties with their friends if they consider their friends to be immoral. Losing friends is likely to exacerbate their mental health problems.
