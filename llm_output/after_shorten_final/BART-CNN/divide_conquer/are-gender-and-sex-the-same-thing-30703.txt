Gender and sex refer to the same concept, the idea that society divides into groupings. Sex is biological but gender is psychological. According to the Williams Institute, in 2016, approximately 0.6 percent of adults in the United States identified as transgender. This translates to just over 1.3 million adults. The average cisgender person may never need to engage with the concepts of sex and gender. By comparison, a trans or non-binary person still faces many obstacles.
