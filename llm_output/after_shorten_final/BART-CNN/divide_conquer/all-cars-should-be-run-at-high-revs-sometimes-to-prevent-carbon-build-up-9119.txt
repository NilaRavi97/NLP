All cars should be run at very high revs (at the upper limit) sometimes to prevent carbon build up. Very high rpms produce high temperatures which burns off built up carbon. However,driving fast is life-threatening and can damage your car. There are mich better methods, this one only makes a slight difference and isn't worth the trouble. It works just as well at 3000 rpm. This does not apply to diesel engines. It does apply to Diesel engines with DPF because the higher exhaust gas temperatures help to burn off the soot caught in the DPF.
