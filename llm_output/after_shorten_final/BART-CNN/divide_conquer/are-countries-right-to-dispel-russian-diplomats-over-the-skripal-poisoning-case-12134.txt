UK has evidence of Russia stockpiling deadly nerve agents for assassinations. UK failed to provide Russia with a sample, in order for them to conclude how the nerve agent managed to get there. Trump and several other high profile figures failed to mention the Skripal poisoning case when talking with Putin. This is likely to provoke Russia, and cause increased tensions between the West and Russia. Most people would prefer not to worsen the current relationship as it may lead to another war.
