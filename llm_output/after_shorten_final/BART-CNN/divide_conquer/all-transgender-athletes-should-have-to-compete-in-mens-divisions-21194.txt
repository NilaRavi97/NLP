Transgender children are more likely to be bullied if they are not allowed to play on the team for the gender that they identify with. Boys should not be forced to compete with women, have to beat them up, or be placed at a disadvantage by having them on their team. Testosterone injections give trangender males an unfair advantage but, Testosterone is not the only indicator of physical performance. The biological distinctions between men and women are not sufficient to override the desires of the individual.
