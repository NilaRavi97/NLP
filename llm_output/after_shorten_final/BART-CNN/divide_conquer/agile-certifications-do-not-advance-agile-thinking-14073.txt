Certifications can be a way for those who are new to Agile to quickly cover a lot of ground. Certifications are a sign that someone has taken some time to learn, they don't necessarily denote seriousness about a craft. 'thinking' may lead to 'wrong' answers in the final exams. Experience counts for way more than training. Agile is a practice, it's a practical approach to building software. As such, it is only through practical application that such a practice can be mastered.
