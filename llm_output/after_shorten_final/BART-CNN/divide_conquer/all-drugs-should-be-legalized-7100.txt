There is no evidence to suggest that legalising drugs will increase drug use. The drugs that people want and find more dangerous are cocaine, opium, and cannabis.

An addict is nonetheless an addict (alcohol to heroin) and child-protective services/health care personnel should at any time have the authority to intervene should ones drug-use influence surroundings or own health to a significant degree.
