In India, more than 113,000 women report abuse by their husbands or in-laws. Decisions based on emotions are less stable than those based on reason. It is safer for an individual looking to get married if the parents find a suitable partner from a network of friends. There are situations where the bride/groom or family lie about crucial aspects such as health history, sexual history and financial assets. Getting a divorce is even more difficult due to familial concerns.
