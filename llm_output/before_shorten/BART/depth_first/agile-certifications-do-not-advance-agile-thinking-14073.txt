Agile certifications do not advance Agile thinking Certifications can be a way for those who are new to Agile to quickly cover a lot of ground. Following a set curriculum makes it easy to know where to start and what core material need to be covered. Certifications are usually obtained through learning, not through thinking. Many certifications are designed in a way that (just) require learning as opposed to understanding. Even if this is true, that does not prove that certifications don't advance agile thinking, just that they are not the most effective way of doing so. Agile is a practice, it's a practical approach to building software. As such, it is only through practical application that such a practice can be mastered
