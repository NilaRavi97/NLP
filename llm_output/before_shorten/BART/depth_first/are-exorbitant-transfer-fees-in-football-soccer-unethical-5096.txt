Exorbitant transfer fees in football (soccer) are ethical. They fees paid are determined by the market. If a club is willing to spend Â£X million on a player then it is because both parties are happy that this deal is fair. The transfer fee is compensation for ending a contract early; factors affecting the fee include how long the contract had left to run. It's therefore not correct to term this purely as a value placed on the player themselves. In this sense it is as ethical as much as market economics is ethical. Putting a monetary price on humans is unethical. Transfer fees have negative effects on individual players. Players are put under pressure if they have large fees. Large fees can inflate players' egos.
