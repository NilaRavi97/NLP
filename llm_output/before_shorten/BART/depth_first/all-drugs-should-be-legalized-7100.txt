Contraband Tobacco Right studies have shown that tobacco and alcohol are both harmful to health problems, yet they are legal. Alcohol and nicotine are widely accepted in western society, and yet can both be considered dangerous drugs. The evidence provided in this claim stems largely from importing cheaper cigarettes from the rest of Europe to the UK. Legalisation of cigarettes did not stop illicit and poor quality cheaper versions. Given the legalisation, there are now big shortages. Cigarettes are overpriced to discourage use because they are so harmful. Illegality drives up the price, and that causes criminality among users who need to gain enough money to buy them. The same could be said of murder despite it's illegality, yet this is not an argument employed
