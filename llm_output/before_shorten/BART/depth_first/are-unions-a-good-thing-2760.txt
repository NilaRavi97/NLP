Unions Are Good Unions lead to better worker benefits, such as health-care. There are many occupations that require union membership, for example Las Vegas casino workers, teachers in most states, and every police officer in the country. Unions prevent workplace accidents. Company policies and well trained, skilled workers prevent more accidents than unions. Union prevention of accidents is valuable even in addition to company policies and training which, possibly or probably, exist because of previous union involvement. Unionized workers make substantially more money than their non-union counterparts. The extra $3.51 per hour (\>$7,300 per year)made by union workers far surpasses the $400 per year that the average union worker pays in dues.
