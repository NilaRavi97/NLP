All our actions are selfish to some degree. Choices/ actions that are based on morality (charity, 'good deeds') are usually ultimately about what kind of person we wish to be, or to be perceived as being. When we give someone a gift or give it to a charity we benefit because we either feel good or think that God will reward us for it. Many people give charity because they want to show off and be seen as charitable by others. Even if there's no tangible benefit from the "selfless" deed, people will still feel better about themselves or some degree of pleasure, which is the true motivation for their actions. If you do a good deed for selfish reasons, you're doing a selfish act.
