Are public speakers that promote self-help making a difference, or just enriching themselves? The difference these speakers make is to motivate people to help themselves. People are often at very low points in their lives when seeking this type of material. So there is a huge incentive to stay relivent and less to be self-critical about the information being said. It might also be a placebo. People might feel more self-confident and be more successful, only because they have the impression that they have been helped. Their advice is often vague. Offering no real plan of action or program that will map out their journey to success. Itâ€™s often just catch phrases and lingo and get you excited but produce no results
