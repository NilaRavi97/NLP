The Milankovitch Cycles are major causes of climate change. It is recognised that the cycles caused the present Quaternary ice age to start. The cycles change over thousands of years. Anthropogenic climate change is much faster. We warm the Earth in 100 years as it naturally happens in 41000 years. For the past 800 thousand years the Earth has moved from glacial to inter-glacial periods consistently in line with the periods of the Milanksovitch cycles. Geologically we are on the way into a new ice age but temperatures are increasing; so are taking the opposite direction. Several reports suggest that manmade warming could even accelerate in the next 10 years. This does not prove that it is the milankov
