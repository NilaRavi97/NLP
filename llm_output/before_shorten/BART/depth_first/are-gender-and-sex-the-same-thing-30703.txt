Should gender and sex be the same thing? Gender and sex are obviously different. Sex is biological but gender is psychological. This makes them closely related to one another but nonetheless separate concepts. Gender is recognised as a concept that variesdepending on the history and culture of the society in which one lives. The ways in which genders are expressed has changed over time and from place to place, suggesting that our culture and norms shape the way in which gender is expressed. Gender can refer to either social roles based on the sex of the person (gender role) or personal identification of one's own gender based on an internal awareness (gender identity). Sex and gender are used interchangeably by many people already Just because "many people" use them interchangeably
