Problems in the developing world are worse than problems in the developed world. Developing countries are characterised by weak states that are inept at providing or unable to provide citizens with social welfare. Otherwise those countries would not have homelessness, poverty, or hunger, not just a case or two, but at a massive level. In these cases it is often a case of unwillingness (on the side of the state) rather than inability to provide these people with their primary needs. America would, for example, be able to provide the level of care that Sweden does, but chooses not to because it believes in a very capitalist notion of freedom. Many basic needs are not met in third-world countries, whereas they are in first world countries.
