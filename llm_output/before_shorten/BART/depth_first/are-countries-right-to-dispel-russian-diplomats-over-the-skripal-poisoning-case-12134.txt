Countries are right to dispel Russian diplomats over the Skripal poisoning case. It helps bring together the countries in show of solidarity. It is opposite to Putin's alleged attempt to divide the West. UK has evidence of Russia stockpiling deadly nerve agents for assassinations in last ten years, according to Boris Johnson. According to the UK Government, Russia is highly likely to have caused this. They had not liaised with the OPCW about the source of the nerve agent until 14th March. Therefore independent analysis is inconclusive. UK failed to provide Russia with a sample, in order for them to conclude how the chemical agent managed to get there. This is likely to provoke Russia, and cause increased tensions between the West and Russia
