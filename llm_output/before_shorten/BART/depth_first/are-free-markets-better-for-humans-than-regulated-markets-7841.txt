Free markets are better for humans than regulated markets. Under a regulated market, services that one might define as a "need" (healthcare, food, housing, etc) are regulated to ensure more equal access. This determination is more accurate than under a free market, where those services are meted out not on a need-based metric at all but based on, and misogyny. A company doesn't care what race or sex an employee is so long as they're more productive than the people they didn't hire. The moment a business starts denying services to customers based on prejudice, a competitor will pop up that doesn't discriminate and drive the other business out. Market regulation is not about curbing its ability to be "free"
