American Football Should Be Banned. Risk taking behaviours should not be discouraged through banning sports such as American Football. The ability to consent to dangerous acts is fundamental to our freedom and autonomy. People should not have the ability to exercise their autonomy to undertake actions that could be detrimental to their self interest. People are not allowed to not wear seat-belts while driving because it is against their own interest to do so. However, modern technology has mitigated the risk of injury and death significantly enough to make driving a car a reasonable decision for anyone to make. American football was nearly banned 110 years ago. In light of the violent nature of the game, perhaps the reasons mentioned for banning the sport over a century ago should be revisited.
