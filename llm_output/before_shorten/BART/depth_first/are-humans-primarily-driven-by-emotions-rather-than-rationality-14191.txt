Humans are primarily driven by emotions, rather than rationality. Thought experiments repeatedly illustrate our decisions are swayed by emotional factors. Simple and classical test - the trolley problem. In the classical example, when there are 5 strangers vs 1 stranger, the results are simple - save 5 strangers. But when the one person is a relative, most people change their mind and decide to kill the five. Decisions to go to war often involve emotional responses, such as invading Afghanistan after 9/11. While the people may have supported the invasion due to an emotional/populist basis, the American government may have had a rational reason to invade, namely to bolster their geopolitical influence in the Middle East. Societies at large act rationally.
