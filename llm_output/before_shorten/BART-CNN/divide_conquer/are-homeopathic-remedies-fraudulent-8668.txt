Proponents of homeopathy claim that greater dilutions (lower concentration) of supposed active ingredients produce stronger effects. Medical science has shown the opposite: that responses are correlated to dosages. Homeopathic preparations are diluted to "30C" in most cases, or 1 part in 10^60. At this level of dilution not even a single molecule of the supposed active substance remains in the preparation. It is not merely fraudulent, but an act of murder, to prescribe homeopathic remedies to those with life-threatening illnesses.
