Decentralized marketplaces require ALL users to host/store and distribute content. This may make it easier to deanonymize users as opposed to buyers and sellers just visiting a website. Centralized marketplace can make performing a sybil attack expensive, and when discovered can be dealt with by administrators. Escrow agents on a decentralized marketplace could easily be bribed or do selective scams. The risk of deanonymization is at least as high for centralized marketplaces as information is usually stored in a central location.
