American Civil War (1861-65) was mainly about slavery. Attacks against the institution of slavery drove the Southern States to secede. North opposing Southern secession, because it wanted to preserve a large and powerful state. If the war was primarily motivated by a desire to stop slavery then the Union should have declared war on Brazil as well, which imported many more slaves than North America. The seceding states explicitly identified with slavery and justified their secession with it.
