The Ancient Olympic Games were held in the same location on the Peloponnese (Greece) for almost 12 centuries, beginning in 776 B.C. The 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics facilitate a railroad link from the eastern to the western coast of South Korea. Political strives and economic crises could thus become a threat to the Olympic Games. Olympic venues serve as an initial push for developing rural areas and city infrastructure. Separate permanent locations for Summer and Winter games could be designated.
