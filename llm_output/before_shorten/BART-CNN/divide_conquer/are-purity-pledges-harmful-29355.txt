Purity pledges reinforce the idea that the value of women is inextricably linked to their virginity. Lack of discussion around consent in purity culture can leave pledgers unable to distinguish between consensual and non-consensual interactions. Virginity can become such a central part of an individual's identity that after having sex they do not understand their identity or role within their community. Forgiveness has been found to be emotionally healthy, especially in the long term.
