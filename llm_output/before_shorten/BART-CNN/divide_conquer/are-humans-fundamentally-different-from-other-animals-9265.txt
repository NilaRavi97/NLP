The value of humans is derived from Psychological and Sociological traits in which we by far exceed any other living being. Creativity is a uniquely human trait. Human basic needs and wants are shared by animals. Extreme specialization is not unusual among animals. We cooperate worse than some types of insects, such as termites, ants and bees. We have a moral understanding of suffering, and our capability to actively change ourselves and our environment for our benefit.
