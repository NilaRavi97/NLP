Public bodies and nationalised industries are monopolies in and of themselves. Government have the power to introduce regulation which prohibits any businesses that competes with a nationalised company. Regulated markets are the only way to ensure companies are environmentally and socially responsible. A business cannot make profits without offering some benefit to people. Nobody would voluntarily hand over their money to a business if they didn't think they were getting a benefit from it. Business may offer benefits to few people, while the negative externalities may impact the rest of society.
