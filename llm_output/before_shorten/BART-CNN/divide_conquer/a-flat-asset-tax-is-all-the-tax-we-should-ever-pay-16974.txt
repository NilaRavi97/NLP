Taxing all return-generating assets the same would better equalize the tax paid by active (job) and passive (money) work. A state shouldn't decide on what policies it enacts based on what requires the least effort. Use of fiscal policy including tax code to control populations is the same philosophy that was shared by the monarchs of old which we thankfully tossed aside for supposed liberty. We should embrace our heritage of liberty not undermine it.
