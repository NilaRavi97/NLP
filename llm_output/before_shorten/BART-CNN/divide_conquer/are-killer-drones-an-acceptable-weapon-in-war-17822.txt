Drones are cheaper than most other high tech military options and cost much less than employing soldiers in the long term. Countries that place a higher value on human life would more likely to win wars, writes Peter Bergen, author of The Drone Wars: The Rise of Killer Drones. The use of drones has largely replaced attempts to capture individual terrorist leaders, meaning they can no longer be interrogated for useful information. Terrorist organisations use drones strikes and the associated harm to civilians as a recruitment tool.
