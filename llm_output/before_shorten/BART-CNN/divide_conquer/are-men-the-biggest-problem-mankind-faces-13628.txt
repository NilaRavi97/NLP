As humans, not machines, we will always have problems with upbringing, DNA and education. Education will never be available to all people, so there has to be a cultural shift. Women cannot be expected to tackle systemic issues like misogyny on their own. It is misogynistic to suggest that women are at fault for the actions of men who oppress them. Teaching your child respect for all humans, regardless of gender, is independent of academic education and contingent on one's personal views.
