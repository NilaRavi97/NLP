Evil is a linguistic construct we created to describe attributes we dislike in other humans. An action can only be described as evil when a human does it. Sadists actually have more empathy that the average person which makes them more effective. Psychopaths do not have empathy and cannot process oxytocin like Neurotypicals. Sociopaths have impaired senses of empathy due to abuse. Human survival is good, therefore love is good and since humans crave love they must be good too.
