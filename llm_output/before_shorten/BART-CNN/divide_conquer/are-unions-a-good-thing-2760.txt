Hard work should be compensated with promotion and bonuses, not minimum wages. Unions provide better training for their employees, which leads to better quality workmanship. Company policies and well trained, skilled workers prevent more accidents than unions. Most union dues are tax write-offs that workers get reimbursed for at the end of the year. The larger the employer the more necessary a union becomes to prevent the hierarchy from becoming tyrannical. All profits in the capitalist mode of production derive from the unpaid wages of labor.
