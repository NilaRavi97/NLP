A free Press is necessary to democracy because, Exposing corruption reduces the incidence of corruption. Media controlled by politicians are less likely to be free to criticise those politicians. Government by the people requires an electorate that is familiar with the issues and the evidence for the positions and policies behind them. A publication that represents the interests of its owner is, by definition not a "free" publication (i.e. one what can publish what is true and important, regardless of bias or influence)
