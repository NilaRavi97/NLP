Failing to offer coding at school puts lower socioeconomic student populations at a disadvantage compared to peers who have reliable technology access at home. Children should be taught general problem-solving and creative skills, not coding. Coding challenges the mind to improve these skills, usually with instant feedback. It slots into the pedagogical niche that used to be filled by learning geometry. Those with an aptitude for coding can discover it early. Writing code is relatively easy to learn.
