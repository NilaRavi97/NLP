Technology has enabled a new form of autocracy - datacracy - as a rival, says Keen. Democracy can leverage the "wisdom of the crowd" in a way that other systems cannot, he says. The existence of emergency powers remains an issue in modern democracies, Keen adds. The 2009 expenses scandal in the UK closed a number of loopholes and resulted in criminal prosecution of wrong-doing, he adds. It doesn't matter how effectively leader are held to account. What truly matters is if the abuses are correctable, Keen says.
