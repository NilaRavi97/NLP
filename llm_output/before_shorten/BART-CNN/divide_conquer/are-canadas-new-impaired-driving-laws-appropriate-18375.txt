Canada's new impaired driving laws regarding cannabis are appropriate and will not need major revision. Innocent people could be fined or falsely imprisoned due to improper regulation. It was illegal to drive high before anyway, all the added laws just take something that was already frowned upon and made it so you could go to jail for 5 years for being a stoner and driving sober. Cannabis is considered an intoxicant, like alcohol. but, Cannabis has a completely different effect on the brain, thus they cannot be compared.
