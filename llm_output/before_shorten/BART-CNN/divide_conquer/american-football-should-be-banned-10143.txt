High School football is exploitative because, Players face many of the same health risks as college football. Children's brains are less developed, which means they are more at risk of brain damage. The NFL does not set black players up for long-term financial success: over 80% of players are either bankrupt or in financial peril just two years after retirement. This is an argument to change the NFL to make it more inclusive, not to ban it outright.
