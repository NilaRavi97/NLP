In 2017, there were more direct deaths from alcohol consumption than from drug consumption. The War on Drugs has led to the mass incarceration of American citizens, and black and brown people are disproportionately targeted by law enforcement. Illegality drives up the price, and that causes criminality among users who need to gain enough money to buy them. Many drugs have good medical properties, legalization would allow science to research these properties and cure different patients. Drug prohibition might be inspired by some kind of racism but abandoning it would not necessarily mean an improvement of the situation for those incarcerated.
