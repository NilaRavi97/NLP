The Milankovitch cycles aren't large enough to explain the recent spike in global temperature. Satellites have been monitoring the Sun since the 1970s — when the fastest warming has been taking place — and the brightening isn't there. Anthropogenic climate change is much faster. We warm the Earth in 100 years as it naturally happens in 41000 years. Several reports suggest that manmade warming could even accelerate in the next 10 years. The sun is the major influence on climate.
