There are enough languages in the world and many of them are even dying or vanishing. It makes no sense to abandon a century or millennia old language spoken by large amounts of people and used in large amount of books, in favor of a new language. It takes too much time to learn any language. To learn a constructed language it takes even more time. And all that time is wasted which is used for learning a. constructed language. The constructed language may in some point of view be dangerous for the way that our brains function.
