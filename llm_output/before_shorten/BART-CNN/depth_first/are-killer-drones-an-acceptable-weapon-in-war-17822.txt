Russia has developed an underwater drone capable of carrying a 100-megaton nuclear bomb. Drones are cheaper than most other high tech military options and cost much less than employing soldiers in the long term. Countries with superior technology are at an advantage. Using drones puts fewer soldiers' lives at risk. Using technology to fight other technology instead of people would reduce the number of battlefield deaths. This would be positive for you and your allies. The most high-tech solution is not always the best solution in warfare.
