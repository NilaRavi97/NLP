Are public speakers that promote self-help making a difference, or just enriching themselves? The difference these speakers make is to motivate people to help themselves. If they were able to produce the claims advertised everyone would be involved in a program. “Self-Help” experts can make ungodly amounts of money. So there is a huge incentive to stay relivent and less to be self-critical about the information being said.
