A bar of soap is better than a bottle of shower gel. Shower gel is more hygienic, especially for a shared shower. A lot of soap does not sting in the eyes. Soap is more convenient in use (no bottle to unscrew/open) Soap lasts longer. A bar is cheaper than shower gel and it is easier to drop soap in the shower. It is difficult to wash your hair with a soap. Short hair can be just as easily be washed with a bar.
