There is a significantly higher level of domestic violence in arranged marriages as apposed to love marriages in Turkey. It is better to live a part of one's life in a loving relationship that eventualy ends in divorce than to be stuck in an unwanted union without a way out. Arranged marriages are a tool which can be used to increase the social status of a family. Raising your social status by possibly jeopardizing your child's romantic future is not a moral thing to do.
