Canada's new impaired driving laws regarding cannabis are appropriate and will not need major revision. It was illegal to drive high before anyway, all the added laws just take something that was already frowned upon and made it so you could go to jail for 5 years for being a stoner and driving sober. Because alcohol has a legal limit and is an intoxicant, cannabis should have one too. Testing blood THC levels are not as reliable for 'intoxication' as testing for blood alcohol levels.
