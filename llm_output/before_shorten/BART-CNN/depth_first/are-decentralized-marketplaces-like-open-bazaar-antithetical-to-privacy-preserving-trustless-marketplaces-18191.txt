Decentralized marketplaces require ALL users to host/store and distribute content, which may make it easier to deanonymize users as opposed to buyers and sellers just visiting a website. The risk of deanonymization is at least as high for centralized marketplaces as information is usually stored, as the name suggests, in a central location. The more people are involved in running a marketplace, and the more eyes are on the software that powers it, the higher the chance that security problems and privacy risks are quickly found and patched.
