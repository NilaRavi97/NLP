The International Olympic Committee (IOC) should create a permanent venue for the Olympic Games. A permanent location could ensure optimum circumstances for the athletes, for example in terms of climate and facilities. A corruption-free bidding process is possible. Taking bribes is legally and morally wrong and should not have a place in sports. 'Globetrotting' Olympic Games enable the hosting countries to showcase themselves as prosperous and being able to keep up with the others economically and culturally.
