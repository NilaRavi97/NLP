Men are the backbone of every known society, and are the main group in charge of providing every major service required to run it. This may be more to do with institutionalised sexism than any particular good on the part of men. Men, as a gender, in general will not evolve as this is a hormonal question. Education will never be available to all people, so there has to be a cultural shift before change can prevail. Culture is inherent to the human condition, unless we are replaced by robots, culture won't disappear.
