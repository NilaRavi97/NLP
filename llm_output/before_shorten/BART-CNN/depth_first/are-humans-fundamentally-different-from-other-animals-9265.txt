Humans do not have enough comprehension about animals' language and reasoning to know for certain whether humans are fundamentally different from animals. Arguments have been made that dolphins are as intelligent, if not more so, than humans, but are limited by their lack of limbs and communication. There is no fundamental difference between grunts/yelps/speaking. Without intensive training in language and skills, humans develop communication methods and behaviours more normally associated with other lesser primates.
