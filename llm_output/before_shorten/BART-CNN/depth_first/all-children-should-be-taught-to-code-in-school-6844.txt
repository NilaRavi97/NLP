Coding can be integrated into pre-existing subjects such as sciences and mathematics. Problem-solving and other skills can also be developed through exercises not related to coding. Failing to offer coding at school puts lower socioeconomic student populations at a disadvantage compared to peers who are more likely to have reliable technology access at home. In the UK, a ten-fold increase in funding computer science at schools is needed, according to the Royal Society. People with existing skills sets are better placed to teach higher levels of Computer Science qualifications.
