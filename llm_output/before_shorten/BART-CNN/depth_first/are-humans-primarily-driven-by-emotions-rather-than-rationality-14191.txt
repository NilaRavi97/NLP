Humans are capable of rational thought but this does not demonstrate that we are not primarily driven by emotions. Decisions to go to war often involve emotional responses, such as invading Afghanistan after 9/11. The manipulation of emotion, rather than rationality, in advertising is demonstrative of the market's acknowledgement that people make choices based more on emotion. The great number of scientific revelations and breakthroughs made worldwide would have been impossible without rational thought. We have evolved to become self-conscious, which is impossible to achieve with emotions alone.
