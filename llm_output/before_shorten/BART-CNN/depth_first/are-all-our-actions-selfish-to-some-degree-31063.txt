The instinct for self-preservation has a biological basis in human evolution. People only do the right thing because they fear being punished if they get caught. Groups with higher numbers of ‘altruists’ are better able to survive the random catastrophic events that happen from time to time. According to the Biblical canon, the reward for good deeds is entry into Heaven, and according to the Quranic tradition, those who do more good deeds than bad shall enter Jannah, or Paradise.
