The opposition to 3D guns is based on the existing Undetectable Firearms Act, 18 USC Sec. 922. Banning a specific piece of knowledge (as opposed to a criminal act) is censorship, and clearly unconstitutional. A digital file which can be directly used to create a weapon without a human even reading it is not 'knowledge' - it is a raw material. It is protected under the 1st amendment, and this fact has been supported by the courts.
