A positive unreasonable belief, otherwise known as placebo, was found effective and even superior to modern medicine in some rare cases. A large Australian study analyzing 1,800 homeopathic studies concluded there is no reliable evidence showing homeopathy is an effective method. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that homeopathy does work. It is not merely fraudulent, but an act of murder, to prescribe homeopathic remedies to those with life-threatening illnesses. In cases where modern medicine can no longer help, perhaps homeopathy would be a positive idea.
