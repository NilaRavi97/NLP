Problems in the developing world are worse than problems in the developed world. Rates of poverty are higher in developing countries, which makes their populations more vulnerable. Third world countries do not contribute to the industrialized economy as those in first world countries, yet receive the benefits from it and them. Some countries run into issues when they receive benefits, as seen with voluntourism (1, 2). This puts third world countries worse off than before (which is bad to begin with)
