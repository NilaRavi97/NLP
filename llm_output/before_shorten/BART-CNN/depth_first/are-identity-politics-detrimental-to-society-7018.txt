Identity is multi-faceted and involves intersectionality on various levels. Addressing under privilege and inequality is important but often created or magnified for political gain. Politicians create minorities as victims whilst pretending to be the heroes who come to their aid. Identity politics breeds division; be it racism, sexism or simple prejudice. Common humanism is a more morally justified approach to achieving justice and equality of opportunity. This roughly describes 'conflict theory' in sociology, not identity politics.
