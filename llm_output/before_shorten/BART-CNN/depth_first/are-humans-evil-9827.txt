There is no objective morality, so humans cannot be evil. Evil is a subjective social concept created by humans, not an inherent property of humans. Infants and young children do things that, on a larger scale, we would consider evil if done by an adult. Psychopaths do not have fear and they judge people all the time. Judgment is required for justice. It not only exists but is morally important. Humans are not evil but they often act evil. Most evil comes from the distinction between US and THEM.
