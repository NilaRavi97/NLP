Voluntarism gives power to those who choose to act in selfish ways, affecting others negatively. Forming healthy social relationships also has many positive effects on both physical and mental wellbeing. This would benefit marginalised or minority social groups, whose human rights would be improved. Civil court in this voluntary society would probably evolve over time to combat breaches of contract and monopolies. A corporation that abuses other people's free market or life would have to be proven in court to be at fault.
