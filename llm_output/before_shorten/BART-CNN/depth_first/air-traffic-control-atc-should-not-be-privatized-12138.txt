Air Traffic Control (ATC) should not be privatized. Private actors are more likely to focus their investment into the most profitable ATCs. The US is the most complex AND safest air traffic system in the world. Next generation technology deployment is not as quick as private sector. Tax payer dollars partially fund private aviation activities. The public funding of the National Airspace System (NAS) system has worked well for over 100 years. The planning which would be involved in privatizing the entire system would take decades and cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
