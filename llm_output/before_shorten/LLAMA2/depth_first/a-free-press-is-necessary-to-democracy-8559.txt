A free press is essential for democracy, as it allows for the exposure of corruption and the provision of accurate information to voters. However, freedom of the press does not mean that anything goes, and responsible journalism is necessary to ensure that the public is well-informed. The interests of media owners can influence the content published, which may not always align with the interests of the people. While specific educational achievements are not required for voting, an informed electorate is crucial for democratic decision-making. A free press can help ensure that voters have access to unbiased information, enabling them to make informed choices and hold politicians accountable.
