It seems like you've provided a comprehensive overview of the arguments for and against anarchism. Here's a summary of the points discussed:

Arguments For Anarchism:

1. People can coexist harmoniously in a social environment without a leader, as seen in some democratic societies.
2. The idea of a natural state of human aggression and warlike behavior is challenged by examples of peaceful societies.
3. Anarchy does not necessarily lead to chaos and violence, as some argue, since people can choose to cooperate and live in peace.
4. The concept of anarchy can be seen as a rejection of the modern-day state and its hierarchical structure.
5. Real-world examples of anarchist societies, such as Zomia, Twin Oaks Community, and Freetown Christiania, exist and have been functioning for some time.
6. New systems, including anarchism, are unproven by definition, but that doesn't necessarily mean they aren't better than existing systems.
7. Most human relationships are voluntary, which can be seen as a form of anarchy in action.

Arguments Against Anarchism:

1. The idea that people should be ready for self-governance leads to the idea that a leader is necessary and people must be controlled.
2. Humans have a long history of intra-species violence, which some argue is a natural state.
3. Morality is not objective and is a product of thousands of years of operation within legal systems, not a natural or inherent human quality.
4. Anarchy is the absence of a higher authority, which can lead to uncertainty and conflict in a society without external authorities.
5. The outcomes produced by an anarchist system of society are unknown, making it difficult to assess its ethical status.
6. Most states do not last long in a state of anarchy, and those that do tend to be failed states.
7. Employer-employee relationships can be seen as exploitative and not truly voluntary, which challenges the idea that all human relationships are voluntary.

Overall, it seems like both sides have valid points, and the discussion highlights the complexity of the issue. It's important to consider both perspectives when evaluating the ethical implications of anarchism as a political philosophy.
