The debate over sanctions on Russia continues, with arguments both for and against their implementation. On one hand, sanctions can be seen as a way to punish Russia for its violation of international law and norms, deter aggressive behavior, protect national interests, and promote human rights. On the other hand, sanctions may be ineffective, counterproductive, harm innocent parties, lack international legitimacy, inconsistently applied, negative impact on global economy, increase tensions, and fail to address root causes.

Some experts argue that sanctions have backfired in the past, making target countries more aggressive. Russia's shift away from the West and increasing dependence on other countries in the BRIC bloc may also reduce the effectiveness of sanctions. Additionally, lifting sanctions could embolden Russia to behave even more brazenly in pursuit of its own interests.

However, sustaining the sanction regime may be necessary for the US and EU to defend their democratic systems, as Russia's actions have directly threatened these systems. Despite the implementation of sanctions, the Russian government has large domestic support for its foreign policy. Nevertheless, an increasing number of Russians favor strengthening ties with western countries, and support for Putin's foreign policy is falling due to a desire to fix domestic issues.

Ultimately, the decision to impose or lift sanctions on Russia requires careful consideration of all the arguments and their potential consequences. It is crucial to find a solution that balances national interests, international law, and human rights while avoiding actions that may escalate tensions further.
