The debate revolves around whether transgender athletes should be allowed to compete in the division that aligns with their gender identity or biological sex. Some argue that transgender females (male-to-female) have an unfair advantage due to their masculine traits, while others believe that hormone therapy and chromosomes should be the deciding factors. It is also suggested that athletic rules should be based on rigid standards like biology, but others argue that biological sex has less impact on athletic performance than hormones. Additionally, some argue that transgender women (male-to-female) should compete with women, while others believe they have an unfair advantage due to their male physical attributes. Ultimately, the debate highlights the need for a fair and inclusive solution that considers all factors.
