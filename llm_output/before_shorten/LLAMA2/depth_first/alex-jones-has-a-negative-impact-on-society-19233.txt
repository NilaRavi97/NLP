Alex Jones has a negative impact on society as his conspiracy theories may incite violence. However, he shouldn't be held accountable for others' actions. He creates awareness about health products and educates listeners about nutrition and clean water. Suppressing his right to speak freely is more damaging than his views. He has the right to express his opinions, but circulating false information can damage public perception. Jones helped get Trump elected, which has had a negative impact on society, and his listeners are influenced by him. However, some people view Trump as a positive figure, and Jones has been right about some important things that the mainstream media overlooks.
