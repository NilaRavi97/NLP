The debate revolves around whether people who do immoral things are inherently immoral or if they can change and be reformed. Some argue that people have the capacity to change and that their sense of morals and ethics develops with age, making it foolish to brand someone as immoral based on one stage of their life. Others believe that labeling someone as immoral can lead to negative consequences such as anger, shame, violence, and suicide. They also argue that correctional facilities aim to rehabilitate prisoners rather than simply isolate them. However, there is no reliable way to connect imprisonment with the permanent status of immorality. The definition of immoral refers to people who do not meet society's standards of morality, and committing immoral actions does not necessarily mean that someone is irreversibly immoral.
