People have a moral obligation to assist others in need. This duty exists independently of whether individuals have historically acted on it successfully. Actions motivated by the greater good may have had negative consequences, but this does not negate the existence of a duty to help others. The philosophy of altruism is distinct from utilitarianism, and it is improbable that acts of genocide were motivated by concern for others' well-being. Assisting those in need may be seen as a long-term investment, create social incentives to reciprocate cooperation, and build a network that protects everyone. Helping others is natural, and religion can compel us to do so. While there may be costs associated with assisting others, it is not necessarily true that we are obligated to sacrifice our lives for another. The concept of duty is independent of personal gain, and logic alone cannot provide moral imperatives.
