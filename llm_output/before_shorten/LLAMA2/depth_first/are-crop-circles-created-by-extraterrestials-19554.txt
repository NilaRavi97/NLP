The debate surrounding crop circles has been ongoing for years, with some arguing that they are created by extraterrestrial beings while others claim they are the work of humans. While there have been numerous theories and explanations put forth, there is still no concrete evidence to support either side. Some argue that the intricate designs and lack of footprints leading to and from the circles suggest that they cannot be created by humans, while others have demonstrated how they can be made using simple tools and techniques. The debate continues, with neither side able to provide definitive proof of their claims.
