Homeopathic remedies are considered fraudulent by many due to the lack of scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness. Despite some rare cases where placebos have shown positive effects, the majority of studies indicate that homeopathy does not work. Homeopathic preparations are often diluted to extremely high levels, rendering it unlikely that any active substance remains in the product. Proponents of homeopathy claim that higher dilutions produce stronger effects, but medical science has shown the opposite - responses are correlated to dosages. The 'oscillo' part of Oscillococcinum, a widely marketed homeopathic anti-flu preparation, references vibrating spheres seen on a microscope slide that were actually air bubbles from a poorly prepared slide. A large Australian study analyzing 1,800 homeopathic studies found no reliable evidence showing homeopathy is an effective method. It can be considered fraudulent and even murderous to prescribe homeopathic remedies to those with life-threatening illnesses when other effective treatments are available.
