  While shower gels are more hygienic and don't leave hair sticking to them, bars of soap are better overall due to their convenience, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. Soap is easier to use and doesn't require unscrewing a bottle, making it more accessible for those who struggle with dexterity or strength. Furthermore, bars of soap last longer than shower gel and generate less packaging waste, which is important given the devastating impact plastic has on the environment. While it's true that soap can sting eyes, many soaps are formulated to be gentle on skin and don't cause irritation. Ultimately, bars of soap are a better choice for those looking for an eco-friendly and practical solution for their shower routine.
