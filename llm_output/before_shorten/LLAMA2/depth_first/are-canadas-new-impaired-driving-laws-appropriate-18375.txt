Canada's new impaired driving laws regarding cannabis are appropriate and won't require major revisions. It was already illegal to drive high before, and the added laws just make it a criminal offense with a 5-year jail sentence for driving sober while under the influence of cannabis. Legal comparisons suggest that the 2ng/ml limit may be too strict, but stricter regulations are necessary to ensure road safety. Testing blood THC levels is unreliable and cannot be compared to testing for blood alcohol levels. Cannabis and alcohol affect the brain differently, so they cannot be treated equally under the law. Occasional cannabis users may be too impaired to drive after smoking something too strong, while frequent users could be fined or imprisoned due to build-up in their system, even if they are completely sober. It's important to enforce similar laws for intoxicants that impair judgment to ensure road safety.
