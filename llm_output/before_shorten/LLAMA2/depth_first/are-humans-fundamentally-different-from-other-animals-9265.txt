Humans and animals share similarities in emotions, self-awareness, cultural structures, cooperation, and unique features. However, humans have a greater degree of self-awareness, advanced language and communication skills, and a greater impact on their environment. Ethical considerations are important when treating animals and the natural world, given humanity's advanced cognitive abilities and technological capabilities. While humans have unique psychological and sociological traits, biology provides the best ground for comparing different species. Ultimately, the difference between humans and other living beings is greater due to factors such as moral understanding and the ability to actively change themselves and their environment.
