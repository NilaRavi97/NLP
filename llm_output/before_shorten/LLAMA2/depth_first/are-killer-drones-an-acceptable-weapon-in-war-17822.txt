The debate surrounding the use of "killer drones" in warfare centers around their effectiveness, affordability, and ethical implications. Proponents argue that drones provide an effective deterrence weapon that minimizes harm to future generations and allows for more precise targeting, reducing collateral damage and civilian casualties. They also point out that drone operators face no danger during missions and that the use of drones exercises pressure on terrorist organizations. On the other hand, critics argue that the use of drones increases the number of fatalities in war, reduces accountability, and could lead to a global drone arms race. They also suggest that the use of drones is a poor way of combating terrorism as it replaces attempts to capture individual terrorist leaders and allows for the recruitment of new terrorists. Additionally, some cultures view the use of drones as cowardly. The ethical implications of drone warfare, including the potential for increased civilian casualties and psychological trauma experienced by drone pilots, are also a subject of concern.
