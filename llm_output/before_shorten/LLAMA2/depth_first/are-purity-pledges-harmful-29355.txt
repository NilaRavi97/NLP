It is a complex and controversial issue whether encouraging young people to wait until marriage before having sex is beneficial or harmful. Some argue that waiting until marriage can lead to happier marriages, lower divorce rates, and better communication and trust between partners. Others claim that abstinence can place an emphasis on developing other aspects of the relationship, such as communication and emotional intimacy, which can benefit the relationship after marriage. However, critics argue that forcing young people to wait against their will can be harmful, as it can lead to feelings of guilt, fear of sex, and a lack of support from parents when they do become sexually active. Studies have also shown that purity pledges are linked to a higher risk of pregnancy and STDs, as individuals who break their pledges may feel less inclined to engage in safe sex practices. Additionally, research has found that divorce rates are not necessarily related to premarital sex, but rather to other factors such as commitment and communication. Ultimately, whether or not encouraging young people to wait until marriage before having sex is beneficial or harmful depends on individual circumstances and values. It is important for individuals to have access to comprehensive sexual education, contraceptive options, and support from parents and society to make informed decisions about their own bodies and relationships.
