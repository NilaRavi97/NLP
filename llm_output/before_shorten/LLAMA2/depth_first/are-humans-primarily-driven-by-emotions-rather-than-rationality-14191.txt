Humans are driven by both emotions and rationality, but emotions play a larger role in shaping our decisions and actions. While societies act rationally, individuals are influenced by their emotional responses. Macroeconomic developments follow rational expectations, but market anomalies show that irrational decisions affect markets. The decision to go to war is often emotionally driven, but governments may have rational reasons for their actions. Humans are capable of rational thought, but it's not always the primary driver. Emotional factors sway our decisions, and thought experiments show that humans are subjective to emotional rhetoric. Advertising manipulates emotions to influence choices, and scientific breakthroughs were made possible by rational thought. Our self-consciousness is a result of both emotional and rational processes.
