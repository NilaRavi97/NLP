Public speakers who promote self-help can motivate people to help themselves, leading to positive changes in their lives. However, some experts make unrealistic claims and profit from desperate individuals, offering vague advice with no tangible plan for success. While some people see improvements, it may be due to the placebo effect or personal factors rather than the speaker's advice. It's crucial for people to critically evaluate the information provided and not blindly follow self-help gurus. The government hasn't taken action against these speakers as their success is personal and difficult to duplicate, but individuals should still be cautious when investing in self-help programs.
