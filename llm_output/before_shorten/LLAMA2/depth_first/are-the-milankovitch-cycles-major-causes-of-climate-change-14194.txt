The Milankovitch Cycles are significant contributors to climate change, but they cannot fully explain the recent and rapid increase in global temperatures. The Sun's influence on climate change varies depending on the time frame, with a small impact over solar cycles and a larger effect over millions of years. However, other factors must be considered as the primary cause of climate change, as Milankovitch cycles alone cannot explain the full range of Quaternary climate change. The measurement of the Sun's radiative output, Total Solar Irradiance (TSI), is currently the best method available, but it may not be reliable, and further scientific evidence is required to establish a definitive correlation.
