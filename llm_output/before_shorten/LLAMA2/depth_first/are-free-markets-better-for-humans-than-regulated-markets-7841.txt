It seems like you've presented both sides of the argument on whether a free market or a regulated market is better. Here's a summary of the points you've made:

Free Market:

* Allows for spontaneous order to emerge, valuing factual, instead of idealized, human needs
* Introduces competition that drives innovation and efficiency
* Allocates resources more effectively than centralized decision-making
* Encourages decentralized resource allocation
* Incentivizes companies to be more productive and efficient
* Allows for natural competition to arise and level out domination of monopolies

Regulated Market:

* Ensures more equal access to services that are defined as "needs" (healthcare, food, housing, etc.)
* Prevents companies from engaging in unethical practices that harm the environment or society
* Allows for government intervention to prevent monopolies and promote competition
* Protects citizens from exploitation by companies
* Can legislate that companies must offer certain products or services at a fair price
* Can create complacency in companies' efforts to improve their environmental and social impact
* May not address issues of environmental degradation and social inequality effectively due to the difficulty in defining and enforcing regulations

It's important to note that both free and regulated markets have their advantages and disadvantages, and the best approach may depend on the specific context and goals of the society in question. A balanced approach that incorporates elements of both may also be possible. Ultimately, the decision on which type of market is better will depend on one's values and priorities.
