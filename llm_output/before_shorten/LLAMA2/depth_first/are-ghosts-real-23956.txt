The debate over the existence of ghosts continues, with some arguing that they do exist while others claim that there is no scientific proof. Those who believe in ghosts point to personal anecdotes and cultural beliefs, while skeptics argue that these claims are unreliable and influenced by factors such as mental illness, hallucinations, and the desire for popularity. Some argue that video evidence is not convincing, as it can be easily manipulated or staged, and that the existence of ghosts cannot be proven through video footage alone. Others suggest that ghosts may be a manifestation of energy left behind by intense events, citing quantum physics as a possible explanation. However, there is no conclusive evidence to support this theory. Ultimately, the debate over ghosts remains inconclusive, with neither side able to provide definitive proof.
