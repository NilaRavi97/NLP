The proposal to provide a wage to primary carers until their child enters school or other care raises several arguments. On one hand, it could help low-income families and solve the challenge of low population growth. It would also provide an economic incentive for people to have children, which could address the issue of ageing populations and shrinking workforce in developed countries. Additionally, child rearing is a significant contribution to society and should receive economic recognition. On the other hand, some argue that it could encourage lazy parents to have more children for money, cheapen the parental experience, and be economically unsustainable. While it is true that raising children is expensive, the wage would likely offset some of the costs but not make childrearing profitable. The feasibility of this measure is also questioned, as it may not be economically viable. However, proponents argue that the money spent on this policy would generate economic activity and help pay for itself.
