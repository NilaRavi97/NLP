In a voluntary society based on the non-aggression principle (NAP), people would interact with each other peacefully and respectfully, without violating each other's rights or initiating force against one another. The NAP can be applied to various aspects of society, such as criminal justice, contracts, and property rights.

In terms of criminal justice, the NAP would imply that individuals who commit violent crimes, such as rape or murder, should be held accountable for their actions. However, instead of relying on coercive taxation to fund a police force, voluntary societies could utilize private defense agencies or community-based justice systems. These systems would be funded through voluntary means, such as private donations or subscription services.

Regarding contracts, the NAP would ensure that individuals enter into agreements voluntarily and without coercion. In case of breaches, civil courts ad honorem could be used to settle disputes and enforce contractual obligations. These courts would operate based on voluntary participation and reputation, rather than coercive taxation or government enforcement.

Property rights would also be protected under the NAP, ensuring that individuals have full control over their possessions and can use them as they see fit, as long as they do not infringe on others' rights. In case of disputes or violations, private arbitration services or community-based mediation could be used to resolve issues peacefully.

The NAP would also limit the role of government to only enforcing violent breaks of the principle. This would result in a small, unobtrusive government with no need for coercive taxation. However, it is unclear how violent infractions could be fairly tackled without an independent funded police force.

In summary, a voluntary society based on the NAP would promote peaceful interactions, respect for individual rights, and limited government intervention. While there are challenges in implementing such a system, it has the potential to create a more ethical and just society.
