The debate revolves around whether countries should dispel Russian diplomats over the Skripal poisoning case. Some argue that it is a political farce to punish before proven guilty, while others believe it is necessary to show adversity to Putin's regime and demonstrate solidarity with the UK. The UK government claims Russia is highly likely to have caused the poisoning, but some question the evidence and suggest that the UK failed to provide Russia with a sample for analysis. There are concerns that the expulsion of diplomats could lead to increased tensions between the West and Russia, potentially leading to another war. However, Boris Johnson has stated that the UK has evidence of Russia stockpiling deadly nerve agents for assassinations in the last ten years.
