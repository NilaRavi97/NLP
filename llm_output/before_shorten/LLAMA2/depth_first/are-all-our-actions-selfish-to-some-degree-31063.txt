It is argued that all human actions are selfish to some degree, as people tend to act in their own interests, even if it appears to be selfless. The motivation behind a selfless act can still be driven by personal gain, such as the desire to feel good about oneself or to avoid feeling guilty. However, this does not necessarily mean that all actions are completely selfish, as people may also act with genuine concern for others. The instinct for self-preservation is a fundamental human drive, but it can be overcome through empathy and rational thought. Religious beliefs and cultural norms can also influence behavior, leading people to act in ways that are perceived as selfless, even if they are ultimately motivated by self-interest. Ultimately, the distinction between selfish and selfless actions can be blurry, and it is up to individuals to reflect on their own motivations and values.
