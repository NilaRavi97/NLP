The debate revolves around the idea of implementing a flat tax, where all assets are taxed equally, regardless of the individual's income or wealth. Proponents argue that this system would be fairer, as it would tax wealthy individuals more than they currently pay, and provide certainty to all taxpayers. They also suggest that it would simplify the tax code and redirect energy from compliance to more productive work. On the other hand, opponents argue that a flat tax would be difficult to implement, as it would require accurately valuing all assets for every individual, including those hidden offshore. They also point out that taxing all assets equally might lower their value, hurting those who rely on them for income. Additionally, they suggest that the idea may be met with resistance from wealthy individuals and those who benefit from the current system, and that it would undermine the principle of liberty.
