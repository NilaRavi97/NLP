The American Civil War (1861-1865) was a complex conflict with multiple causes, including slavery, states' rights, and economic disagreements between the North and South. While slavery was a significant issue, it was not the sole cause of the war. The seceding states explicitly identified with slavery, but also cited other reasons such as self-determination and economic interests. Attacks against slavery were a primary grievance, but tariffs and industrialization also played a role. Some Northern states still allowed slavery after the war's end, and President Lincoln revoked emancipation proclamations issued by generals during the war. The eventual emancipation of slaves in the South was used as a political and military strategy, not an end goal. Economic reasons and issues against central authority were also significant factors. The war was ultimately caused by disputes between the North and South regarding their differing economic values, including calls for African American equality from the North, which threatened the slavery-based agrarian lifestyle in the South.
