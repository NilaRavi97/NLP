The debate revolves around the usefulness and necessity of constructed languages. Some argue that they are helpful in bridging communication gaps, while others believe they are a waste of time and won't replace established languages. Constructed languages like Klingon and Dothraki have their own grammar and vocabulary, but most are created for artistic purposes rather than practical use. Chomsky believes humans are born with an innate knowledge of grammar, making it impossible to create a new artificial language. However, some people argue that constructed languages can be useful in simplifying international communication and can be learned through apps like Duolingo. Despite this, the majority of constructed languages fail to gain significant use and are often seen as a creative exercise rather than a practical tool.
