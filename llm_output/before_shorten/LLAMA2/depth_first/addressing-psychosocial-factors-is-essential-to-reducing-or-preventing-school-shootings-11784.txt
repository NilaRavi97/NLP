It is crucial to address psychosocial factors to prevent school shootings, as they are a key cause of mass shootings. While gun control efforts may limit access to guns, it is impossible to prevent a possible school shooter from obtaining a weapon. Research has shown that 80% of perpetrators had been socially excluded and were seen as outcasts, and over three-quarters of school shooting perpetrators had threatened or attempted suicide. Addressing psychosocial factors such as trauma, abuse, depression, personality disorder, etc. can help identify individuals at risk of committing such crimes. However, it is important to note that addressing psychosocial factors does not imply that the mentally ill are violent, and the analysis should consider other factors beyond mental health.
