The debate surrounding the publication of blueprints for 3D-printed firearms centers on the potential threat to public safety and the question of censorship. Proponents argue that the availability of these blueprints could lead to the proliferation of untraceable, undetectable, and unstoppable firearms, posing a significant risk to society. Opponents contend that banning the publication of blueprints is an infringement on freedom of speech and that it will not ultimately prevent the manufacturing of firearms using 3D printers. They argue that accessing blueprints does not automatically lead to illicit activity and that regulating these files would be pointless since they can be recreated independently by other individuals. Additionally, they emphasize that traditional manufacturing equipment is legal for private citizens to own, and it is legal to manufacture a firearm for personal use, making the regulation of blueprints an unnecessary restriction. The opposition to 3D guns is based on the existing Undetectable Firearms Act, which prohibits the manufacture, sale, or possession of firearms that are not detectable by metal detectors or x-ray machines. However, the Supreme Court has yet to decide whether 3D-printed weapons are constitutional or not. The ATF has carried out tests in which 3D guns have successfully fired multiple lethal rounds, and special ammunition has been designed to prevent the explosion of 3D-printed firearms. While the debate continues, it is clear that the availability of blueprints for 3D-printed firearms raises significant concerns about public safety and the potential for misuse.
