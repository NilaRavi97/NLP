The debate around identity politics is complex, with different perspectives on its role in society. Some see it as a necessary means to bring attention to marginalized groups and advocate for their rights, while others criticize it for creating divisions within society and oversimplifying complex issues. Identity politics can be seen as a form of humanism, valuing individuals equally, but it can also create combative tension that hinders the process of achieving equal rights. It is not the creator of division, but a reaction to existing division. Critics argue that it is incompatible with democracy, as it implies that "privileged" people cannot understand the lived experience of "oppressed" groups, and factionalism along demographic lines can lead to bad policies. However, identity politics can also promote votebanks, which can inhibit societal progress and secularization. The debate ultimately depends on one's perspective, and a balance between identity politics and universal humanism approaches may be necessary to achieve true equality and justice for all individuals.
