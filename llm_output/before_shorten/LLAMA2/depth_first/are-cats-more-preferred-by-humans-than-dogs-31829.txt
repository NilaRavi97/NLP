Cats are generally preferred over dogs as pets due to their lower maintenance and cost. Cats eat less food and drink less water, and they do not require bathing or grooming like dogs. They also do not need to be walked every day. Small dog breeds can be cheaper to own than larger dogs. A study showed that dogs cost nearly twice as much as cats in their first year. Dogs are more playful than cats, but some cat breeds are known for their playfulness. Cats are cleaner than dogs and spend less time grooming. However, dogs are better companions and friends due to their intelligence, bonding, and obedience. Cats are more independent and do not rely on their owners as much as dogs do. They also have a higher level of intelligence, as shown by their ability to outcompete dogs for scarce food supplies and their lower shedding of fur. Dogs have been domesticated longer than cats, and they have undergone more genetic changes, making them more tailored to human preferences. Despite this, cats are currently more popular than dogs, with 63% of pet owners owning dogs and 43% owning cats. Dogs bond with humans more strongly than cats do, and they are better at survival. Cats are often misread by humans and are thought to be less affectionate than dogs, but they still express affection, desire, and trust. Cats are self-cleaning, but they still need to be bathed occasionally. Dogs have been loyal to humans for thousands of years and have more open attributes such as happiness. A study showed that dogs playing with their owners had higher levels of oxytocin, a hormone triggered by social bonding and love-induced happiness, than cats. Finally, cats are typically less expensive than dogs to care for, with lower boarding costs due to their small size.
