It's important to note that making blanket statements about an entire gender being better or worse than the other is not accurate or fair. Both men and women have their own unique strengths, weaknesses, and contributions to offer. It's important to recognize and appreciate these differences rather than trying to compare or hierarchize them.

That being said, here are some points that could be made in response to the statement "Women are better than men":

1. Physical strength and endurance: While men generally have greater muscle mass and bone density than women, which can give them an advantage in certain physical tasks, women have been known to excel in endurance activities such as marathons, triathlons, and long-distance cycling. Additionally, women have made significant strides in traditionally male-dominated sports such as weightlifting and powerlifting.
2. Emotional intelligence and empathy: Research suggests that women tend to score higher on emotional intelligence and empathy tests than men. This could be due to socialization and cultural expectations, but it's also possible that there are biological differences at play.
3. Education and career advancement: Women have made significant strides in education and career advancement in recent decades. They are now more likely to graduate from college and hold advanced degrees than men, and they are increasingly represented in traditionally male-dominated fields such as medicine, law, and business.
4. Risk-taking behavior: While men tend to engage in riskier behaviors such as reckless driving and drug use, women are more likely to take risks in other areas such as entrepreneurship and investing. This could be due to a variety of factors, including societal expectations and cultural norms.
5. Life expectancy: Women tend to live longer than men on average, with a life expectancy gap of 6.7 years in the US. This could be due to a variety of factors, including differences in lifestyle choices and access to healthcare.
6. Responsibility for sexual activity: While women are generally more responsible for their sexual activity than men, this is not necessarily a reflection of inherent gender differences. Rather, it's likely due to societal expectations and cultural norms around gender roles and sexuality.
7. Fertility and reproductive health: Women's fertility and ability to produce healthy offspring decline at an earlier age than men's, which could be seen as a disadvantage. However, advances in reproductive technology have made it possible for women to conceive and have children later in life, mitigating this difference somewhat.
8. Representation in extreme sports: While women are underrepresented in some extreme sports such as weightlifting and powerlifting, they are increasingly represented in others such as ultra-marathons and Ironman triathlons. Additionally, women have made significant strides in traditionally male-dominated sports such as skiing, climbing, and surfing.
9. Space exploration: While men have historically dominated space exploration, women are increasingly represented in this field as well. A number of female astronauts have traveled to space, including Sally Ride, who became the first American woman in space in 1983.

In conclusion, while there are certainly differences between men and women in terms of physical strength, emotional intelligence, education, career advancement, risk-taking behavior, life expectancy, responsibility for sexual activity, fertility and reproductive health, representation in extreme sports, and space exploration, it's not accurate or fair to make blanket statements about one gender being better than the other. Both men and women have their own unique strengths, weaknesses, and contributions to offer, and it's important to recognize and appreciate these differences rather than trying to compare or hierarchize them.
