The debate centers around the role of men in society and their contribution to societal ills. While some argue that men are the source of many problems, others maintain that they are also the backbone of every known society and provide essential services. The discussion touches on the idea that sexism is institutionalized and that gender roles are not necessarily a result of biological differences. The argument is made that men are physically stronger and more risk-tolerant, leading them to take on jobs that are more dangerous and strenuous. However, it is also acknowledged that women play a crucial role in raising men and that they cannot be expected to tackle systemic issues like misogyny alone. The debate concludes by highlighting the importance of education and cultural shift in bringing about change, while also noting that religion and culture will likely continue to exist in some form.
