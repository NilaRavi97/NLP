The debate centers around the statement "Men are the biggest problem mankind faces." One side argues that men are the backbone of society and provide essential services, while the other side claims that men are responsible for many societal ills, such as oppression and violence. Some argue that women have a major role to play in raising men and that education can solve the problems created by men. Others believe that men will not change and that religion and culture will eventually disappear. The debate also touches on the topic of gender traits and how they evolve over time.
