The debate centers around whether all dating sites should include background checks. Argument 1.1. suggests that personal data would be vulnerable to cyber attacks, while argument 1.2. counters that making online dating enjoyable outweighs the risks. Argument 1.3. adds that background checks can help weed out married or separated individuals, leading to more successful relationships. Paid sites should implement background checks since they require a fee, while free sites should be optional but not mandatory. Argument 1.6. suggests that free sites won't effectively create a standard protocol for dating networks. Criminals and catfishers will be discouraged by background checks, but some users may not want to submit to a check simply to go on a date. Paid sites could increase their membership prices, potentially leading to a loss of revenue.
