The debate revolves around the importance of addressing psychosocial factors in preventing school shootings. Some argue that addressing these factors deflects attention from gun control efforts, while others believe that both are important and should be investigated. Psychosocial factors such as mental illness, trauma, abuse, depression, personality disorder, etc., are considered key causes of mass shootings. Addressing these issues can help prevent school shootings, but it is also crucial to recognize that mentally ill individuals are not inherently violent and that other psychosocial factors contribute to the stigma of violence. Additionally, addressing psychosocial factors does not necessarily address the root causes of gun violence. Ultimately, a comprehensive approach that considers both gun control and psychosocial factors is necessary to prevent school shootings effectively.
