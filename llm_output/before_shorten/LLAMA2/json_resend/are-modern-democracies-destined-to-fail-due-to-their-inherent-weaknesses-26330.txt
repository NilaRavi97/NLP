The debate revolves around the effectiveness of democracies in holding leaders accountable for their actions, particularly when they abuse their power. One side argues that democracies are ineffective in this regard, while the other side counters that it doesn't matter how effective leader accountability is, what matters is if the abuses are correctable. Another argument is presented that societies post-feudalism have vulnerabilities in their systems, as demonstrated by recent events such as the Arab Spring. The debate is supported by attacks and counter-attacks between the different arguments, with no clear conclusion.
