The debate revolves around whether driving at high revs (revolutions per minute) is beneficial or not. One side argues that it helps to burn off carbon build-up in the engine, while the other side claims that it is dangerous and can damage the car. Some argue that driving at high revs is not worth the trouble, while others suggest that it works just as well at lower revs. Additionally, there are arguments that this method only makes a slight difference and that there are better methods to achieve the same goal.
