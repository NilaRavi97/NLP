The debate revolves around whether public speakers who promote self-help are making a positive difference or just enriching themselves. Some argue that these speakers motivate people to help themselves, leading to real benefits. Others claim that the industry is not regulated, and speakers can make false claims and exploit desperate people. Additionally, some argue that the advice given by self-help experts is often vague and lacks a clear plan of action. There are also concerns that these speakers' success is personal and cannot be easily replicated by others.
