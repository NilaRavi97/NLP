The debate revolves around the relationship between sex and gender, with some arguing that they are not the same thing (1.4.), while others believe that recognizing their difference is important for reducing obstacles faced by trans and non-binary people (1.2.). Another argument suggests that upholding a sex/gender distinction impedes progress (1.3.2.1.), while some feminist theorists argue that biology is shaped by social understandings (1.3.2.1.). Additionally, there are arguments that not everyone's gender identity conforms to their assigned sex at birth (1.3.3.), and that gender is a social/cultural construct that varies depending on history and culture (1.4.1.). The debate also touches on the idea that our culture and norms shape the way gender is expressed (1.4.1.1.).
