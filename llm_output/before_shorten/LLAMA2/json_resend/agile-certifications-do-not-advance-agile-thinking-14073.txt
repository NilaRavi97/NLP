The debate revolves around the effectiveness of Agile certifications in advancing Agile thinking. Some argue that certifications are a way for those new to Agile to quickly cover a lot of ground, while others believe they only prove one's ability to memorize and regurgitate information. Proponents argue that certifications support and are built on current ways of thinking, force people to think deeply about the material, and prove one's seriousness about their craft. On the other hand, critics say that certifications lock you into one way of thinking/methodology, don't advance Agile thinking, and reward those who are good at taking tests rather than practical application. Experience is considered more valuable than training, and some certifications require practical experience. Ultimately, the effectiveness of Agile certifications depends on various factors, including the individual's motivation, existing capacity, and the type of certification.
