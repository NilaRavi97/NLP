The debate centers around the appropriateness of Canada's new impaired driving laws regarding cannabis. Some argue that the laws are too strict, citing that blood THC levels are not always a reliable indicator of intoxication.

Some also point out that occasional smokers could be fined or imprisoned due to build-up of THC in their system, even if they are completely sober. Ultimately, the debate highlights the complexities of regulating cannabis use and the need for careful consideration when creating laws surrounding it.
