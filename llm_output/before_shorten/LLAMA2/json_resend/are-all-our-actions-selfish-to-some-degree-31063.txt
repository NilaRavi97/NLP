The debate revolves around the question of whether people do good deeds for selfish reasons or not. Some arguments suggest that people do good deeds for personal fulfillment, recognition, or to escape punishment, which could be seen as selfish motivations. Others argue that people can do good deeds for altruistic reasons, such as empathy and rational thought, and that cultural norms and values can also influence behavior. The debate also touches on the idea of self-improvement and the role of intention in determining the morality of an action. Ultimately, the debate highlights the complexity of human motivation and behavior.
