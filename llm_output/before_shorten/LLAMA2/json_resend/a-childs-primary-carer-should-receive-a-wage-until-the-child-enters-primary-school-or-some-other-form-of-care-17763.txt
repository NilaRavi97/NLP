The debate revolves around the idea of providing a wage to parents who are the primary caregivers of their children until they enter primary school or some other form of care. The argument in favor of this proposal is that it would help low-income families and provide an economic incentive for people to have children, which could solve the challenge of low population growth confronting many nations. Additionally, child raising benefits society just as much as any other job and therefore should receive economic recognition.

On the other hand, some argue that such a measure may not be economically viable or that it would interfere with parenting practices and cheapen the parental experience. Others believe that raising children is the responsibility of the family and that people should have children for love, not money.

Overall, the debate centers around the question of whether providing a wage to primary caregivers would be beneficial or feasible, with arguments both for and against the proposal.
