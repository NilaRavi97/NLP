The debate centers around the role of Milankovitch cycles and anthropogenic climate change in shaping the Earth's climate. One side argues that Milankovitch cycles are the primary cause of climate change, while the other side suggests that anthropogenic climate change is the dominant factor. The debate also touches on the reliability of measurements used to assess the sun's radiative output and the significance of solar variations in climate change.

Key points include:

* Milankovitch cycles have a significant impact on climate change, but their role in recent warming is uncertain.
* Anthropogenic climate change is a major factor in the current warming trend.
* Solar variations have a small influence on climate change over short periods but may play a larger role over longer timescales.
* Measurements of the sun's radiative output are simplified and may not be reliable guides to climate change.
* The reliability of scientific evidence in proving causality in climate change is uncertain.
