The debate centers around the claim that women are better than men in terms of physical ability. The main argument against this claim is that women have a higher risk of miscarriage in their 30s, which could impact their physical performance (node 1.17.3). Additionally, it is argued that women's weightlifting records are inferior to men's, and that any achievements by women in physically demanding activities do not necessarily mean they are better than men (nodes 1.18.1 and 1.18.2). However, there are also arguments that women have achieved impressive feats in extreme endurance races and have been to space, Mount Everest, the North and South Pole, and completed other demanding sport events (nodes 1.18.4 and 1.18.5), which could support the claim that women are equal to or better than men physically. Ultimately, the debate hinges on how one weighs the various arguments and whether physical ability is the sole determinant of "better" (node 1).
