1. The Civil War was not just about slavery, but also about states' rights and economic factors.
2. The North and South had different economic values, with the North protecting its industries and the South relying on agriculture and slavery.
3. The Tariff of 1828 and calls for African American equality from the North threatened the South's way of life and led to secession.
4. President Lincoln did not emancipate any slaves in Union states, and manumission was not approved in Washington, DC until April 16, 1862.
5. The Emancipation Proclamation did not immediately free all slaves in the Confederacy, as it only applied to areas under Confederate control.
6. The Corwin Amendment, which protected slavery, was proposed in Congress but not passed.
7. The Civil War was a cultural divide between the North and South, with different views on slavery and states' rights.
8. Thomas Corwin of Ohio introduced an amendment to protect slavery, while William Seward of New York presented a similar amendment to the Senate.
9. Four Union states had slavery: Maryland, Missouri, Delaware, and Kentucky.
10. President Lincoln revoked emancipation proclamations issued by generals during the war twice, demonstrating that emancipation was used as a political and military strategy rather than an end goal.
