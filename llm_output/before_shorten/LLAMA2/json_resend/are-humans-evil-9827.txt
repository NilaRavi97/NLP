The debate revolves around the question of whether humans are inherently good or evil. The argument that humans are inherently good is supported by the fact that they have the capacity for empathy and compassion, which are positive traits. However, the counterargument is that humans also have a tendency to crave violence, as seen in the popularity of violent media and the existence of conflict throughout history.

The debate also touches on the subjectivity of evil, with the assertion that what one person considers evil, another might see as good. Additionally, it's pointed out that humans act in their own self-interest, which can sometimes be seen as evil. The role of judgment and fear in human behavior is also discussed, with the argument that judgment is necessary for justice, but that fear can also lead to harmful actions.

The debate highlights the complexity of human nature and the difficulty of making sweeping generalizations about whether humans are inherently good or not. Both sides present valid points and counterarguments, leaving the final conclusion up to the reader's discretion.
