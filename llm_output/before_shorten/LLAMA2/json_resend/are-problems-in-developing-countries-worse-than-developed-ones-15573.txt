The provided argument map suggests a discussion about the disadvantages faced by developing countries in the global economy. The main points argued are:

1. Developing countries are hurt more by economic crises due to their limited resources and lack of control over their economies.
2. Developed countries have stronger negotiating power, which can lead to unfair trade agreements and other international problems.
3. Developing countries rely on developed countries for complex products and expertise, which can limit their ability to negotiate.
4. Developing countries need to maintain a good reputation to receive development money and avoid invasions or protests.
5. Basic needs are not met in many developing countries, whereas they are in first-world countries.
6. The problems faced by one person or group can have a butterfly effect, affecting everyone else in some way.
7. The extent to which people are affected by problems can differ, and some people may even benefit from systems that enable exploitation.

The map also includes several sub-points and counterarguments, such as the idea that developed countries can use their power to force developing countries to accept unfair trade agreements, or that some basic needs are not met in first-world countries as well. The argument map represents a nuanced discussion of the challenges faced by developing countries in the global economy.
