The debate revolves around the idea of implementing a flat "Asset Tax" on all citizens, where everyone would pay the same percentage of their assets regardless of their income or wealth. The arguments for this proposal include:

* It would be fair and equal for all citizens.
* It would simplify the tax code and redirect time and energy to more productive work.
* It would reduce the power of wealthy people and big corporations.
* It would provide certainty to all tax payers.
* It would equalize the tax paid by active (job) and passive (money) work.

The arguments against this proposal include:

* It could negatively impact the equity and bond market, potentially leading to a recession.
* It would be difficult to accurately value all assets for all individuals, especially with offshore accounts and hidden wealth.
* It could incentivize people to hide their wealth or move it offshore.
* It would not take into account the individual's income or ability to pay.
* It could lead to a decrease in government revenue.

Overall, the debate centers around the idea of fairness and equality in taxation, with some arguing that a flat asset tax would achieve this goal, while others believe it would have negative consequences for the economy and certain groups of people.
