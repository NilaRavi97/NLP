The debate revolves around whether transgender athletes should be allowed to compete in sports based on their gender identity or biological sex. The arguments for and against are as follows:

Arguments For:

* Transgender athletes should be able to compete in the gender category that aligns with their gender identity.
* Hormonal treatment can reduce the advantage of transgender women (male-to-female) over non-trans women.
* Transgender women who have not undergone hormonal treatment still have an unfair advantage due to their male physical attributes.
* The guidelines for international competition suggest that it's testosterone that gives an advantage, not chromosomes or genitals.

Arguments Against:

* Transgender athletes have an unfair advantage due to their biological sex.
* Men are proven to have better spatial awareness than women, which gives transgender women an unfair advantage in sports.
* Chromosomes determine sex, and sex determines athletic advantages and disadvantages.
* Transgender women who have not undergone hormonal treatment still have the strength, reflexes, and spatial awareness of a male, which gives them an unfair advantage against non-trans women.
* Allowing transgender athletes to compete based on their gender identity would create an uneven playing field.
