The debate revolves around the role of real estate brokers and whether they are necessary or can be replaced by technology. Some argue that brokers provide valuable services such as staging properties, negotiating prices, and providing expert knowledge, while others believe that these services can be automated through technology, rendering brokers obsolete.

One argument against brokers is that they charge high commissions, which can be a burden for sellers. Additionally, some argue that the use of technology, such as the Multiple Listing Service, can provide the same services as brokers without the need for human intervention.

On the other hand, supporters of brokers argue that they provide a personal touch and can negotiate better prices for sellers. They also point out that technology cannot replace the human element in real estate transactions, such as providing emotional support and guidance during the home buying process.

The debate also raises the question of whether governments should legislate to create services that would render brokers obsolete. Some argue that this would be a mistake, as it would impose a burden on government resources and finances for a service that is not essential. Others believe that proper legislation could provide the means to create services that would make brokers unnecessary.

In conclusion, the debate around real estate brokers and technology is complex, with valid arguments on both sides. While some see technology as a way to automate services and reduce costs, others believe that human expertise and personal touch are essential in real estate transactions. Ultimately, it will depend on how technology evolves and how governments choose to regulate the industry.
