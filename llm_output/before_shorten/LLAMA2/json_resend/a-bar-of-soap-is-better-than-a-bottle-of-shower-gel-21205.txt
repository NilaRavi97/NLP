The debate revolves around the comparison between using a bar of soap and shower gel. The pro arguments for soap include its longevity, convenience, and environmental friendliness. On the other hand, the con arguments against soap include its potential to sting eyes, difficulty in washing hair, and old-fashioned image. Shower gel, on the other hand, is considered more hygienic, generates less packaging waste, and is easier to distribute. However, it can also sting eyes and is less convenient to use due to the need to unscrew/open a bottle. Ultimately, the choice between soap and shower gel depends on personal preferences and priorities.
