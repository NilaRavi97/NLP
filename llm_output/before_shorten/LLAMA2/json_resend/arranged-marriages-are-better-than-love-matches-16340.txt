The debate centers around the idea of whether or not a person can love their partner for life. One side argues that it is unrealistic to expect that every day in a marriage will be a blissful experience, while the other side presupposes that a person can love their partner for life. The first argument is attacked by the second argument, which states that this viewpoint is too pessimistic and does not take into account the idea of loving someone for life.
