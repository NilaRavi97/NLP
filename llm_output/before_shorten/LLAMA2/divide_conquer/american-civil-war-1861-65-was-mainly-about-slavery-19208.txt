The American Civil War (1861-65) was fought over slavery and economic rights, with the South seeing slavery as crucial to their economy and way of life, while the North opposed secession and sought to preserve the Union. The war was driven by cultural divisions, views on slavery, and economic factors, and emancipation was used as a political and military strategy rather than an end goal.
