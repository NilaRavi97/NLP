The government is considering a proposal to provide financial support to primary caregivers until their child enters school or another form of care. The aim is to address low population growth, recognize the value of child-raising, and support low-income families. However, concerns include potential government interference in parenting and the possibility of people having children for the wrong reasons. While some argue that people should have children for love, not money, others point out that raising children is extremely expensive and this wage would help offset some of the costs but not make childrearing profitable.
