In this debate, participants discuss the role of men in societal problems and their responsibility in addressing gender roles and institutionalized sexism. While some argue that cultural transformation is necessary, others emphasize the role women play in shaping men's behavior. The debate highlights the complexity of gender roles and the need for a nuanced understanding of their impact on society. It is wrong to attribute society's ills to all men, as each individual is unique and not all men possess the flaws often associated with them. However, as the historically dominant gender, men have played a significant role in creating society and its problems. A cultural shift is necessary before change can prevail, but increased access to education worldwide gives reason for optimism. Teaching children respect for all humans, regardless of gender, is not dependent on academic education but rather personal values. Religion and culture will eventually disappear, and so will the need to conform to such strictures. Each generation is less religious than the former, and this trend is expected to continue. Culture won't disappear, as it is inherent to human nature, but religion may lose its appeal as sources of insecurity diminish.
