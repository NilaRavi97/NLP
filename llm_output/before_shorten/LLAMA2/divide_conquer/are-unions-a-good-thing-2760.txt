The debate over unions' impact on productivity, wages, and workplace values continues. Some argue that unions improve worker benefits and promote equality, while others believe they lead to decreased productivity and corruption. Studies suggest that unions do not inhibit productivity and may even enhance it. Unions provide a democratic outlet for workers to have a say in workplace administration and can prevent worker abuse, asymmetric information in wage negotiations, and allow collective grievance addressing. However, unions can also be corrupt and form networks that lead to isolation and monopoly, resulting in protectionism and extortion. Ultimately, the impact of unions depends on the leadership and how they prioritize worker interests.
