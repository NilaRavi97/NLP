The debate over publishing 3D-printed gun blueprints raises concerns about public safety and freedom of speech. While some argue for regulation, others see it as censorship. The ATF prohibits 3D-printed firearms due to their undetectability, making it difficult to regulate them. Digital blueprints pose a challenge for selective publication, and prohibiting them entirely may be the only solution to prevent illegal circulation. However, entirely prohibiting an individual from publishing personally generated content is a suppression of their right to freedom of speech.
