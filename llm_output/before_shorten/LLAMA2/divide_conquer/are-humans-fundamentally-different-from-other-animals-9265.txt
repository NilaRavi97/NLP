Humans and animals share common traits, but humans possess a unique capacity for moral understanding and self-change. While biology explains some similarities, psychological and sociological factors distinguish humans. Values like moral understanding of suffering are often attributed to biological and physical aspects of human experience, which cannot be exclusively claimed by humans. However, given what we know about animals' mental capacities, there is no reason to believe they possess such values.
