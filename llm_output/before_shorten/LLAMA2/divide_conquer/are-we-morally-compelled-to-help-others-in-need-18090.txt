There is a debate about whether people have a moral obligation to assist others in need. Some argue that helping others leads to successful cooperative societies and may be seen as a long-term investment. Others believe that there is no universal obligation to sacrifice for others, as morality is personal and relative. Altruism, the concern for the well-being of others, is different from utilitarianism and is less likely to motivate atrocities. Actions motivated by the greater good may have had negative consequences, but this does not negate the existence of a duty to help others. Failure to act on this duty is seen as a mistake, indicating that people are morally compelled to assist others in need.
