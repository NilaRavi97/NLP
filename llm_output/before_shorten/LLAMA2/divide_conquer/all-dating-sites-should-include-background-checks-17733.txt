All dating sites should include background checks to ensure safety and security for their users. Paid sites should offer this feature as part of their services, while free sites can offer it as an optional feature. Despite potential risks, background checks can help weed out unsuitable individuals and increase the chances of successful relationships. However, free sites shouldn't be required to implement this feature due to resource limitations. Users should proceed with caution when using free dating sites, as there may not be a standard protocol for dating networks. There is a small chance that implementing background checks could lead to a loss of revenue for some dating sites, as some users may not want to submit to a background check simply to go on a date.
