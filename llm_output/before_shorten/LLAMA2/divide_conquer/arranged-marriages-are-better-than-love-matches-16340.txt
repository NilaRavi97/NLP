In the debate between arranged and love marriages, both types have their advantages and disadvantages. While arranged marriages provide stability, they can limit personal choice. Love marriages offer freedom, but risk divorce. A successful marriage requires mutual respect, communication, and compatibility regardless of the type of marriage. Incorporating familial validation can improve marriages, but individuals should not sacrifice their happiness for family relationships. Ultimately, a happy marriage and strong family relationships are possible with either type of marriage. However, arranged marriages can sometimes lead to deception, as individuals may feel pressured to hide aspects of their past or future to avoid judgment from their families.
