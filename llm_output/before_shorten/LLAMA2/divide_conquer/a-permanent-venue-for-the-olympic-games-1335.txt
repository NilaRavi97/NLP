The International Olympic Committee is debating whether to establish a permanent venue for the Olympics. While some argue it would ensure optimal conditions for athletes and spectators, others believe it would give the host country an unfair advantage and go against the spirit of the Games. An alternative proposal suggests having permanent venues in different parts of the world, ensuring fairness and sportsmanship while covering maintenance costs with membership fees. However, concerns about unequal travel time for athletes from far away have been raised. A permanent venue could still embody the international factor by having different countries decorate the facilities or organize the events. Hosting the Olympic Games is often seen as a symbol of societal advancement, but it has also been associated with authoritarian regimes and human rights violations. A permanent venue would not necessarily solve these issues, but alternating countries taking charge of organization could promote fairness and sportsmanship. The ultimate goal of the Olympic Games is to bring athletes from all over the world together, not to showcase countries' spending power.
