Homeopathic remedies are considered fraudulent and ineffective, going against scientific principles and the understanding of matter. Prescribing homeopathy for life-threatening diseases can be considered murder as it goes against proper science-based medicine and there are other effective treatments available. However, in cases where modern medicine is no longer helpful, homeopathy may have a slight chance of working.
