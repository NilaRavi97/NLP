In a debate about using cryptocurrencies and prepaid credit cards for online porn purchases, one speaker argues that cryptocurrencies are risky due to their reliance on technology, while the other speaker suggests that prepaid credit cards offer discretion. The discussion touches on the legality of buying porn online and the potential for embarrassment if a partner discovers the purchase through a credit card statement. While some sex workers prefer anonymous transactions, others offer non-cash payment options, such as credit cards, to keep their business private.

However, it's important to consider that not everything considered shameful is amoral. Providing a way of making related purchases in private can have value, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like menstruation and mental health, which are often stigmatized and considered shameful or threatening. Similarly, there is significant shame attached to various sexual activities, even those that are not widely considered amoral. Ultimately, the choice between cryptocurrencies and prepaid credit cards for online porn purchases depends on individual preferences and values.
