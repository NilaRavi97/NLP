Developing countries face challenges such as poverty and corruption, worsened by voluntourism and unequal aid distribution. Historical factors like colonialism have hindered their ability to address these issues, causing prolonged suffering for their citizens. First-world countries also have unmet basic needs, resulting from unwillingness rather than inability, with examples like America choosing not to provide the same level of care as Sweden due to capitalist beliefs. The exploitation of sweat-shop laborers is not a problem for big owners of industries, it benefits them. One person's problem may affect everyone differently, but the extent or meaning of the effect differs generally.
