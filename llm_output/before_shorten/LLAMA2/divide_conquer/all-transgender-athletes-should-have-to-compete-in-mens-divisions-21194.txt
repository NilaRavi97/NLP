The debate about transgender athletes in sports revolves around whether they should compete in their identified gender's division or be separated by weight or ability. Those in favor argue that transgender athletes should not be discriminated against and that athletics should be separated by weight or ability, not gender or sex. On the other hand, opponents believe that transgender athletes who have undergone male puberty possess an unfair advantage over biological females, while those who haven't undergone puberty can compete with women. The decision requires careful consideration of all arguments and factors involved.
