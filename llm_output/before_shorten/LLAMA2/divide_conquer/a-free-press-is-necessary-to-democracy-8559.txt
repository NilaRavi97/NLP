In a democracy, a free press is vital for exposing corruption, holding leaders accountable, and upholding democratic norms. High-quality reporting provides citizens with accurate information, despite the prevalence of clickbait content. A free press supports citizens' right to criticize and hold politicians accountable, leading to the selection of politicians who reflect voters' actual values. However, media controlled by politicians may prioritize promoting their own interests instead of keeping them in check. While the freedom to say and write anything true is a fundamental value of democracies, speech that promotes hatred, bigotry, and libel can harm society. Ultimately, opinions published in the media will reflect the interests of their owners rather than the people.
