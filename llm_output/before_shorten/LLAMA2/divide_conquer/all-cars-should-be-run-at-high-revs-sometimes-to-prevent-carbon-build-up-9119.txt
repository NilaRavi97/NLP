There is a debate among mechanics and manufacturers about how to burn off carbon buildup in cars. Some suggest running the engine at high revs, but manufacturers recommend regular oil changes and proper driving habits instead. Running the engine at 3000 rpm is considered a safer alternative, but this does not apply to diesel engines. Driving fast is not only illegal but also dangerous, contributing to the high number of road crash deaths each year. However, it is applicable to diesel engines with DPF as the higher exhaust gas temperatures help burn off soot caught in the DPF.
