The debate on pre-marital sex and purity culture emphasizes the importance of comprehensive sexual health education and open communication. While some individuals advocate for waiting until marriage, others believe that sexual experiences are essential for personal growth. Purity culture can perpetuate harmful ideas about sex and women's self-worth, leading to feelings of guilt and shame. People should have the freedom to make their own choices about their sexual health and well-being without fear of judgment or condemnation. Research suggests that casual sex can have positive effects on mental and physical health, but these benefits can also be attained through an active sex life within a marriage. Purity pledges can reduce the spreading of STIs, but they are not foolproof as abstinence is the only way to completely avoid STIs.
