In a debate about individual freedom and social responsibility, two sides disagree on the role of government intervention. One side proposes a system based on the non-aggression principle (NAP), while the other side worries about protecting minority groups from harm. A compromise suggests limiting government intervention to enforce violent breaks of the NAP, but implementing such a system may be challenging.

Discussions like this can help spread ideas, but ultimately, it may seem utopian and unlikely to happen. The idea of ending coercive taxing of citizens and instead relying on private funding or voluntary efforts to build roads is another benefit of a voluntary society. However, implementing such a system would require significant changes in societal attitudes and behaviors.
