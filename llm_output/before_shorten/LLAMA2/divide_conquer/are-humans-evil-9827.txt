Humans are capable of both good and bad behavior, influenced by factors such as oxytocin and brain variations. The concept of neutrality in morality is questionable, and love and violence can be used for positive or negative purposes. Evil is a matter of perspective, and humans often act in ways that harm others. Survival is a fundamental aspect of human nature, just like other organisms. Judgment is required for justice, but it also raises questions about the morality of certain actions.
