  Agile certifications are controversial. While some find them helpful for introducing newcomers to Agile principles, others believe they may reinforce existing mindsets and limit adaptability. Certification programs prioritize profit over innovative thinking, and while they may lead to wrong answers if obtained through learning without understanding, they can also force people to think deeply about the material, leading to new ideas. Experience counts for way more than training because Agile is a practical approach to building software that can only be mastered through practical application. However, this does not prove that certifications don't advance agile thinking. Some certifications require practical experience, even if within the context of the certification.
