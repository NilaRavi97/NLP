Canada's new impaired driving laws set a legal limit for cannabis consumption, aiming to ensure road safety. Critics argue the limit is too strict, potentially fining or imprisoning innocent people due to improper regulation. Frequent users may face penalties due to build-up in their system, even if sober. The laws aim to balance road safety and individual freedom, but cannabis's unique effects on the brain make it difficult to compare to alcohol.
