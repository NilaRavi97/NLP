A flat "Asset Tax" could simplify the tax code and provide certainty, but it may have unintended consequences like changing investment behavior and potentially leading to a market crash and recession. An asset tax is the most fair system of taxing citizens, as it taxes everyone based on the value they actually hold/control, rather than the value that transiently passed through them. However, a flat tax may be perceived as fair, it can also lead to a loss of wealth redistribution, as the same percentage tax rate applies to everyone regardless of their income level or acquisitive power. Changing the entire system to one of a flat tax would likely allow ample work for existing accountants and lawyers. A flat tax would mean that wealthy people would pay more than they do now since they generally pay proportionally less than regular people in terms of an overall tax rate number. This means they would fight this idea and fighting an idea war with wealthy people is too hard. But, the government should put their efforts into convincing society of the policy's benefits, and trying to pass legislation and policy to enact such a tax. Tax incentives are a key way the government can direct the behavior of people and businesses, but using fiscal policy, including tax code, to control populations is the same philosophy shared by monarchs of old, which we have thankfully tossed aside for liberty. We should embrace our heritage of liberty, not undermine it.
