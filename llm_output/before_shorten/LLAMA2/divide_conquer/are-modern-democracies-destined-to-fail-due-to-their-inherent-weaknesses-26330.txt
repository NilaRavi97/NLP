Technology can both enhance and undermine democracy. On one hand, it can facilitate participation and stability through strong civil societies. On the other hand, authoritarian regimes can exploit democratic tools to manipulate public opinion and bypass traditional checks and balances, as seen in the Nazi's use of propaganda. Additionally, technology has enabled new forms of autocracy, such as datacracy, which challenge democratic values. Democracies struggle to hold leaders accountable for extreme abuses of power, but ultimately, what matters most is if the abuses are correctable.
