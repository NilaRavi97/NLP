The debate on gender and sex highlights the distinction between biological traits and societal roles, personal identification, and expression. The LGBTQIA+ movement advocates for inclusivity, accuracy, and workability, particularly for marginalized communities. Ensuring concepts are accurate and workable is crucial, especially for sex, a widely used term in medical and legal settings. Non-binary and trans* individuals face challenges in being recognized due to the gender dichotomy, and their lived experience should be included in concepts of sex and gender to reduce obstacles they face in their daily lives. While sex and gender are distinct concepts, the concept of gender is tied to sex and cannot be seen as completely independent.
