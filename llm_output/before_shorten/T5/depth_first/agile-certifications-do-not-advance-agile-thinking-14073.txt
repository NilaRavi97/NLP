certification programs exist to make money for the training companies, not to encourage new thinking . many certifications are designed in a way that (just) require learning, not through understanding . certifications lock you into one way of thinking/methodology (scrum, kanban, etc) and not how agile applies across multiple methodologies . experience counts for way more than training. it is impossible to get experience without first understanding some basics .
