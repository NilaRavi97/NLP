legalising all drugs (not only soft ones) would be seen as a giving up sign from the government/authority on that matter . the use of psychoactive substances has been part of human culture for thousands of years . when the government legalises something it sends the message that the substance is acceptable and a legitimate form of recreation . this is an argument against incarceration for drug related crimes, not for the outright legalisation of drugs .
