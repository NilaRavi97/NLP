Arranged marriages have sparked considerable debate, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Proponents argue that love within marriage can develop over time and suggest that the stability it brings, family involvement, and lower divorce rates in societies practicing arranged marriages are benefits. Critics, however, highlight the potential for marrying without love, the risk of family interference, and that it reinforces regressive social norms. They also argue that arranged marriages diminish personal agency, often disregard sexual orientation, and that the institution could become a mask for forced marriages. Some studies emphasize the significance of love as an enduring and crucial element of marriage, insisting that love marriages are preferable as they are based on mutual choice. The success of a marriage, however, is largely subjective, and it cannot be claimed that one system is universally better than the other.
