The debate juxtaposes the merits of bar soap versus shower gel. Proponents of soap argue it is more cost-effective, lasts longer, convenient to use without packaging, and reduces plastic waste, important for environmental conservation. However, critics highlight hygiene concerns with shared soap leaving hair residue, soap's tendency to sting eyes, and it being considered outdated. Others counter that sting-free soaps exist and short hair can be washed effectively, while shower gels also have the potential to irritate eyes. They also note that soap's tendency to drop is outweighed by its benefits.
