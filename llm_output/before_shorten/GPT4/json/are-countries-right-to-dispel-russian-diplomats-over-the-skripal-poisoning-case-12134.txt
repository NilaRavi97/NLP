The debate centers on whether countries should expel Russian diplomats over the Skripal poisoning case. Advocates for expulsion cite the UK government's belief in Russiaâ€™s likely involvement and the need to show opposition to Putin's regime, with a united front potentially deterring further transgressions. They also mention UK evidence of Russia stockpiling nerve agents. Critics argue against preemptive punishment without definitive proof, noting the lack of independent analysis and failure to consult with the OPCW. Concerns about exacerbating tensions with Russia and prioritizing Western solidarity over national interests also contribute to the opposition.
