Homeopathy is labeled fraudulent for conflicting with scientific principles, such as the improbability of dilutions containing any active ingredient and yet claiming efficacy. Critics argue it's unethical to market placebos as real medicine and potentially dangerous when used for serious illnesses. While some cite the placebo effect as a defense, this view is countered by the insistence that medicine should be based on statistical efficacy, not rare success cases. Legal perspectives consider informed consent important to negate fraud, but the expectation is that sellers should be transparent about homeopathy's lack of scientific backing. Overall, the dominant stance is that homeopathy, contradicting modern medical knowledge and dilution principles, is fundamentally fraudulent.
