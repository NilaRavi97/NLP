The argument examines the moral obligation to help others, highlighting support through cooperative success, long-term mutual benefits, and religious and natural inclinations to foster goodwill. Cooperation, such as in Korea's societal mobilization, builds social networks that protect all members. Yet, dissent arises from moral relativism, the cost of altruism to the individual, and a lack of rational benefit. The dangers of utilitarian motivations causing atrocities are contested; altruism is differentiated from utilitarianism, and failures in helping are seen as moral shortcomings, affirming our duty to aid others.
