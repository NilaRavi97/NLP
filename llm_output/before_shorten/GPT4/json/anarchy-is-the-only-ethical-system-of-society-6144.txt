The debate on whether anarchy represents the only ethical society centers around the premise that coercion is inherently unethical and anarcny allows individual freedoms to flourish without government coercion. Proponents argue that governments, by definition, are coercive and violate natural rights, and thus anarchy is a more ethical system that respects voluntary interactions and individual liberty. Critics counter that coercion is sometimes necessary to uphold social order and protect the vulnerable. They suggest that anarchy is unrealistic, potentially leading to more abuse, and risking instability or the emergence of authoritarian regimes. Additionally, discussions underscore how anarchy could handle common societal challenges like economic externalities, cooperation on large projects, national defense, and responsible behavior without centralized authority. Some argue that anarchy would encourage responsible behavior through voluntary and social norms. However, skepticism remains about the practical viability of anarchy, given historical precedents of failed attempts and the need for some governmental functions, raising concerns about its overall ethicality and sustainability.
