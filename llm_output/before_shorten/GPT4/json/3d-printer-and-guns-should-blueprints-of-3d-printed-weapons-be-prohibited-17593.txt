There's a contentious debate over the publication of 3D-printed firearm blueprints on the internet. Proponents argue that it's a constitutional right, akin to freedom of speech and that blueprints are just another form of knowledge. They also point out that current laws still apply to 3D-printed firearms and the technical knowledge to create functional guns isn't prevalent. Opponents state that 3D printed guns are untraceable and undetectable, challenging public safety and existing laws. They stress the potential for illegal proliferation, making it easier for ineligible individuals to access firearms, and they argue that regulation is feasible and won't completely stop the spread but will limit it.
