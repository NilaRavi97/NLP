The debate explores whether problems in the developing world are more severe than in the developed world. Arguments in favor highlight the higher poverty rates, lack of social welfare, and inability of governments in the developing world to address issues effectively, often exacerbated by legacies of colonialism, debt, and corruption. Opposing arguments assert that problems in developed nations can also be severe, with issues like minority suffering, gentrification, and global challenges such as climate change affecting both worlds. Some claim that the problems are interconnected on a global scale, suggesting that issues in one part of the world inevitably impact another. It's also argued that the developed world, due to stronger negotiation power, may impose its problems and solutions onto developing countries, which can have detrimental effects. There are also points about exploitation and whether the developed world genuinely aids the developing world or primarily serves its own interests.
