The debate focuses on whether all human interactions should be voluntary. Proponents suggest it could protect human life, respect personal autonomy, and support marginalized groups by ensuring interactions are consensual, potentially improving human rights. They also argue voluntarism aligns with human free will and could work alongside court systems respecting the non-aggression principle.

Opposition highlights challenges, such as the impracticality of enforcing such a principle, the potential for minorities to be disregarded by those in power, the effects of involuntary factors like taxes and citizenship, and the difficulties in maintaining law and order without coercion. Moreover, concerns about natural human interactions essential for development, the role of government in market failures, and the practicality of a purely voluntary society raise further objections to the proposal.
