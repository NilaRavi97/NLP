The debate on whether all drugs should be legalised centers on government legitimacy, public health, societal impact, and historical and cultural considerations. Advocates argue that legalisation could resolve inconsistencies in drug policies, reduce drug-related violence, protect the cultural significance of certain substances, enhance research, and respect individual autonomy. Conversely, critics express concerns that legalisation could lead to increased drug use among youth, contribute to a public health crisis, and exacerbate social inequalities. They stress the potential for increased crime and violence. The argument encompasses complex issues, including misconceptions around 'hard' and 'soft' drugs, impacts on mental health, and the effectiveness of existing prohibitions. The broader context includes the negative effects of criminalization on marginalized communities and the potential financial benefits of regulated drug markets.
