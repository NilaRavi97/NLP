The debate revolves around whether committing immoral acts makes a person inherently immoral. Arguments supporting this claim suggest people have the capacity to change and morality evolves with time. It's argued that moral codes are subjective, guilt might follow immoral acts, semantics don't dictate permanence, and labeling as immoral leads to harm like suicide or violence. Counterarguments claim that criminal behavior implies inherent immorality, some people may not feel regret, and those unable to control their actions or distinguish right from wrong may be deemed immoral. The debate also addresses the role of imprisonment and recidivism rates in determining morality.
