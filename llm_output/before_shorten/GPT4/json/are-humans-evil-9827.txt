The debate over whether "Humans are evil" features arguments both for and against this claim. Proponents argue that humans commit violence against each other, act in self-interest, and have a history of warfare, citing instances such as the harming of others for pleasure (sadism) and enjoyment of violent media. These views are challenged with counterarguments that evil is a socially constructed, subjective concept. Critics highlight that humans aren't born evil, displaying empathy and altruistic behaviors, even in children. They argue the presence of objective morality within cultures and note that behaviors deemed evil are influenced by nurture rather than nature. The argument also surfaced that the definitions of good and evil are often culturally or personally relative, with judgment being required for justice rather than perpetuating evil.
