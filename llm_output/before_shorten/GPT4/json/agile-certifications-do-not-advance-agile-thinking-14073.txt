Debate exists over whether Agile certifications foster Agile thinking. Proponents suggest certifications provide an entry point and structured learning path, demand deep reflection on material, and demonstrate a commitment to the craft. Critics argue certifications may primarily profit training companies, encourage rote learning over understanding, lock practitioners into specific methodologies, and favor test-taking skills. Experience is cited as more valuable than training, with the practical application of Agile principles considered crucial for mastery. However, some certifications do incorporate practical experience, and the importance of foundational knowledge before gaining experience is acknowledged.
