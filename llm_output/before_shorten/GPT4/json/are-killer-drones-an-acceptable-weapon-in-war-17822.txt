The debate on the acceptability of "Killer Drones" as a weapon in war encompasses several key points. Proponents argue that drones provide an effective deterrent and limit future generational harm, claiming that countries with superior technology and value human life are at an advantage. They suggest drones can pressure terrorist organizations by restricting their operations. Conversely, critics contend that drones may lead to increased war casualties due to lower accountability and trigger a global arms race. Concerns are raised about the potential cowardly perception of drone use, ethical implications being diminished as if in a video game, and the problematic use against terrorists without obtaining valuable information. Additionally, the supposed advantages of technology are challenged by the notion that high-tech is not always the best, and that cultural views should not impede the adoption of new military methods.
