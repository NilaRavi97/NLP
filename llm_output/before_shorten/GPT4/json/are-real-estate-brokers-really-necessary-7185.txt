The debate questions the necessity of real estate brokers in society. Arguing against their necessity, it is suggested that technology empowers buyers to independently handle property transactions, possibly leading to the rise of a single dominant platform like "RealEstateUber," although this claim is contested with examples of new market creation. Some argue the broker's expertise adds value and is required for high-stake transactions, yet opinions vary on whether brokers increase sale prices enough to justify their commissions. Concerns are raised about brokers' incompetence, outdated or dishonest practices, and the potential for monopolies with automated services. Proponents for brokers emphasize their role in matchmaking and valuation, while critics believe informed sellers can independently achieve successful sales, citing excessive commissions and potential reform to make brokerage obsolete.
