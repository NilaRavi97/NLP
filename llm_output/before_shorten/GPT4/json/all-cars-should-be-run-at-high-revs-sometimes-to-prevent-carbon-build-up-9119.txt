The debate centers on whether frequently running cars at high RPMs is advisable to prevent carbon buildup. Arguments supporting this include that high temperatures at high RPMs burn off carbon, and some mechanics advocate for it. However, concerns about safety, potential car damage, the irrelevance to modern cars, and better alternative methods challenge the practice. Some argue it is unnecessary as vehicle manuals would suggest it if beneficial, while others claim it works just as efficiently at lower RPMs, referencing a VW Passat manual that recommends regular driving within a specific RPM range for diesel engines with DPF to assist in carbon burn off. Counterarguments note that the practice does apply to diesel engines, as higher temperatures aid in soot burn off in the DPF.
