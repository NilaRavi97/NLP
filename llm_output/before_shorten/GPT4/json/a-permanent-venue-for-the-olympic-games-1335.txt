The debate over establishing a permanent venue for the Olympic Games involves various pros and cons. Proponents argue it would focus on the sport and athletes, reduce critical scrutiny and bad press on host countries, optimize conditions for athletes, and eliminate the wasteful practice of deserted post-Games venues. It is also suggested as being financially sensible, preventing corruption in the bidding process, and returning the event to its ancient origin in Greece.

Critics counter that a permanent venue could lead to a "home-field advantage," loss of excitement and multicultural elements, and potential unfair situations for nations never getting to host. Concerns also include the risk of political or economic issues affecting the venue, and the practicality of accommodating both Summer and Winter Games. Proponents suggest rotating venues among continents or isolating the venue to mitigate the risk of favoritism and political influence.
