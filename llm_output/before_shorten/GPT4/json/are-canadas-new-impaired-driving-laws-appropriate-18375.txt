The debate centers on Canada's new impaired driving laws for cannabis. Arguments against it note that someone can be jailed for driving sober due to THC buildup in frequent users, and draw comparisons to lenient limits in Colorado versus stringent ones in Australia, where recreational use is illegal. Critics also fear innocent people could be punished due to unreliable methods of THC intoxication level measurements. Proponents argue that strict regulations are necessary to prevent impaired driving, likening cannabis to alcohol as intoxicants. However, opponents argue that unlike alcohol, cannabis's effects vary greatly and thresholds for intoxication should reflect this, instead of arbitrary legal limits.
