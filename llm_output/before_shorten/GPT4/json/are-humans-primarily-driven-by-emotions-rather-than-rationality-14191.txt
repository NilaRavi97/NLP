The debate centers on whether humans are primarily driven by emotions or rationality. Arguments suggest society's rational actions, such as macroeconomic policies, indicate individual rationality, countering the emotional decision-making like the reactionary war choices post-9/11. It's noted that societal structure relies on rational policymaking. However, subjectivity in rational judgment and the fact that people often realize post-hoc rational alternatives to past actions are highlighted. Emotional sway is evidenced in scenarios like the trolley problem and susceptibility to populism, yet rationality's role in scientific progress and evolution of self-consciousness is recognized, suggesting a complex interplay between emotions and rational thought.
