The argument that men are the biggest problem mankind faces is vigorously debated. Some assert that men, as societal backbones providing essential services, are vital despite societal ills possibly stemming from institutional sexism. Others suggest that women's influence in raising men partly shapes their societal impact. Counterarguments highlight that blaming men overlooks individual differences and ignores the universal desire for power that drives both genders. The complexity of gender roles, influenced by biology, historical dominance, and cultural shifts, underscores the difficulty in pinpointing the root of societal issues. Optimism for educational accessibility contrasts with sentiments that deep-seated problems in human nature resist easy solutions. Additionally, there are divergent views on the future relevance of religion and culture in shaping society.
