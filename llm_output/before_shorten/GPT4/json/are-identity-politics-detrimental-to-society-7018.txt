Identity politics are contentious within society, with arguments that they erode individual value by reducing people to mere representatives of their social groups. Critics contend that assumptions about beliefs and interests based on race or gender lead to prejudiced judgments and impractical politics due to intersectionality's complexities. Meanwhile, supporters argue that identity-based grouping doesn't deprive individuals of uniqueness and can facilitate the removal of barriers to individual liberties, such as anti-racism efforts. The debate extends to whether identity politics result in groupthink, promote self-victimization, or hinder society's progress by distracting from more pressing global issues.

However, proponents assert that identity politics are essential for advocating for oppressed groups, helping them voice their unique problems and campaign for equal rights. They argue that identity politics have historically been instrumental in securing rights for marginalized groups, from abolition of slavery to women's suffrage, showcasing its significance in democratic societies. The discussion also acknowledges the potential of identity politics to foster understanding across different segments of society and solidarity within.

In contrast, some believe identity politics damage the democratic fabric by instigating division and inhibiting open discourse. Others indicate that while identity politics might not be inherently democratic, they augment democratic processes by allowing diverse voices to participate in dialogues aimed at a common goal. This division within identity politics reveals the larger question of balance between addressing needs of specific groups and the universal push for equitable society advancement.
