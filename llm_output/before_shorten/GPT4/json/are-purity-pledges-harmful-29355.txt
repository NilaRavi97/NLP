The argument graph reflects the debate on purity pledges' consequences. Proponents argue that purity pledges offer an alternative to a culture of casual sex, providing support networks and empowering individuals to control their sexuality. They are seen as a means to rebel against hypersexualization and stereotypes. Additionally, proponents believe they protect from negative health impacts, mental health issues like shame and depression, encourage healthier marriages, and prevent teen pregnancies and STDs.

Critics, however, counter that pledges contribute to harmful stereotypes, encourage a culture of shame around casual sex, and increase the burden on victims of sexual violence. They assert that pledges can lead to psychological issues and impose heteronormative and patriarchal worldviews. The effectiveness of abstinence pledges is also questioned, with evidence suggesting that most pledgers eventually have premarital sex.

Overall, the debate encompasses issues of stigmatization, gender inequality, mental health, and the impact of religious and cultural norms on sexuality and personal choice.
