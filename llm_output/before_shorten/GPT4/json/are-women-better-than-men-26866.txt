The debate over whether women are better than men includes various arguments and counterarguments. Some arguments for men allege they are more rational, historically influential, and competitive, with achievements in STEM, leadership, and physical strength. However, these claims are countered by pointing out systemic inequalities, such as the exclusion of women from intellectual pursuits and voting rights, and the suggestion that competitiveness and leadership do not inherently equal virtue. On the other hand, arguments in favor of women emphasize empathy, commitment to sexual responsibility, lower crime rates, and longer life expectancy. Additionally, there's a higher percentage of women graduating from educational institutions. The overarching sentiment suggests that comparing genders is complex due to social contexts, variations among individuals, and the absence of an objective scale of goodness.
