The debate centers around whether new constructed languages are useful. Proponents argue they facilitate technology interaction and creative exercises in language design, also aiding in understanding linguistic structures and adding to existing knowledge, citing programming languages and notations as positive examples. Moreover, the simplicity and focus on ease of learning in auxiliary languages are highlighted, alongside examples like Dothraki which was created with unique grammar. Opponents counter that expanding vocabulary of current languages suffices, robots can learn human languages, and point out the impracticality with many languages already dying out. They mention the inefficiency of learning constructed languages, with alternatives like translation apps being more practical, despite their limitations. Concerns are also raised over possible negative impacts on our brains, and the historical lack of success in establishing new artificial languages despite it being possible to create them.
