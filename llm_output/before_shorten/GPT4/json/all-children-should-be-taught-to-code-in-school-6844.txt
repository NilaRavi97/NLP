The debate around including coding in school curricula is multifaceted. Proponents argue that coding fosters cognitive skills like logic and problem-solving, is vital in our digital world, can reduce the gender gap in programming, and is essential for literacy in today's society. Moreover, it can open pathways to in-demand STEM careers and creative expression. Conversely, critics say it could overcrowd curricula, add to teacher training challenges, and question its value given the resources available online and evolving industry needs. There's a suggestion that coding may not be inherently difficult for children and can be integrated into play, addressing concerns about age-appropriateness and screen time.
