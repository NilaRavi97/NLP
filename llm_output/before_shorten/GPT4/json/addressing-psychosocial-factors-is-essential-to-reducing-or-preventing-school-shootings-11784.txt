The argument graph explores the importance of addressing psychosocial factors in preventing school shootings. Advocates argue that while gun control may limit access to weapons, it doesn't fully prevent shootings, as those intent on violence could obtain guns illegally or use other weapons. Supporting evidence suggests that social exclusion, suicide threats, and psychosocial issues are prevalent among shooters. Opponents emphasize that these factors alone don't predict mass shootings, as many suffer from such issues without becoming violent. Some argue focusing on psychosocial factors diverts attention from gun control, while others warn of stigmatizing the mentally ill despite research showing no significant link between mental illness prevalence and shooting rates. The debate continues with the need for further research to identify accurate predictors of risk.
