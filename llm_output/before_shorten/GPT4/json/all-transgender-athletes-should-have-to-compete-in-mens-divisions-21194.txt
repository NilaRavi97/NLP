The argument centers on whether transgender athletes should compete in men's divisions. Proponents argue male-to-female transgender athletes retain advantages from male characteristics, citing testosterone, anatomy, and physical size. An alternative view acknowledges variations, suggesting pre-puberty transitioners be allowed to compete with women. Critics challenge separating by gender, advocating for weight class or ability-based athletics and highlighting discrimination issues. Some contend that trans individuals should compete according to identity, noting bullying risks for children and personal desires. However, others assert that biological sex impacts sports performance and fairness in competition must be considered.
