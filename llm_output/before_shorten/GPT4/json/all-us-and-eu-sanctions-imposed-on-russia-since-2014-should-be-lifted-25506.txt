Sanctions on Russia are debated with multiple angles, including economic and political implications. Many argue sanctions harm innocent Russian citizens and bolster nationalism while others contend that targeted sanctions minimize harm. It's suggested sanctions may boost opposition against the Russian government. However, opinions differ on Russian citizens' actual support for their government's actions in Ukraine. Some state sanctions strengthened oligarchs and increased state economic involvement, while others claim sanctions have constrained Russia's economic development and military spending. Sanctions also have international effects; they disrupted global aluminum markets and increased tensions within the EU and between the EU and the US. Some see sanctions as a moral obligation to counter Russia's international law violations and aggression, such as the annexation of Crimea and interference in elections. Conversely, others argue sanctions provoke Russian aggression and hinder international peace, calling for reconciliation and lifting sanctions to avoid further escalation. Despite sanctions, Russia remains economically resilient and continues to pursue aggressive actions and build alternative international alliances, putting into question the long-term efficacy of the current sanctions regime.
