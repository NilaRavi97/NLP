The debate centers on whether Milankovitch Cycles are the primary cause of climate change. Critics argue that changes in these cycles don't account for the recent rapid increase in global temperatures and criticize reliance on the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) measurement. They point out inconsistent arguments about the cycles' influence, suggesting anthropogenic factors have a more significant immediate impact. Some argue that although the cycles may have initiated the current ice age, other factors are contributing, and that geological evidence suggests an impending ice age contradicted by the current warming trend. Proponents maintain that the cycles are consistent with historical glacial and interglacial periods, but there's contention about the precision of this correlation.
