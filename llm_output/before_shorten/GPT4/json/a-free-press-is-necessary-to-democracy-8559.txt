The debate examines whether a free press is essential to democracy. Supporters argue that a free press exposes corruption, promotes informed political choices, and serves as a crucial democratic mechanism by reinforcing democratic processes. It's viewed as fundamental to informed consent and essential for an electorate familiar with policy evidence. Critics counter that press freedom can lead to sensationalism over facts, misinformation, and bias reflecting media ownership interests. It's noted that free speech, including a free press, can have limits, like protecting against harmful expressions, without being unfree. The discussion includes the idea that even without educational prerequisites for voting, an unbiased press is necessary for reasoned voter decision-making.
