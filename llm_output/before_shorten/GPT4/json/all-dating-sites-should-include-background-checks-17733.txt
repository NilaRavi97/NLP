The proposal that all dating sites should include background checks is supported by various arguments highlighting increased safety by deterring criminals and catfishers, improving relationship success rates leading to marriage, and enhancing users' online dating experiences. It is suggested that paid services, already charging fees, are obligated to implement these checks. However, concerns are raised about user privacy risks due to potential cyber-attacks, especially given the weak cyber security reputation of dating platforms. Additionally, there are fears about deterred users, increased membership costs, and possible revenue losses for the sites if background checks become mandatory.
