The proposal that primary carers should receive a government wage until their child enters primary school sparks debate. Critics argue it could lead to intrusive government oversight, although others suggest an unconditional wage could prevent this. Detractors claim child-rearing is a personal choice, not warranting societal support, while some say state aid could provide equal opportunities, especially for low-income families. Concerns about encouraging childbirth for economic gain and the potential for economic unviability of such a measure are raised, countered by examples like Germany's child allowance and the argument that the policy could stimulate economic activity. Proponents underline child-rearing as work worthy of reward, benefiting society by maintaining a workforce, although some feel monetary reward should come from private economic transactions, not government subsidies.
