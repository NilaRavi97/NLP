The debate focuses on whether the American Civil War was mainly about slavery. Some argue it was about preserving the Union and opposing Southern secession, while others claim it was explicitly rooted in slavery, as evidenced by secession declarations that cited slavery as the primary reason. Counterpoints suggest that slavery was legal in some Union states and that Lincoln's revocation of emancipation orders indicates the war was not solely about ending slavery. Others propose that economic and political strategies, cultural divisions, and state rights including disputes over tariffs played significant roles. The Corwin Amendment and slavery's legality in Union states are cited to support claims that the war had broader underpinnings beyond slavery.
