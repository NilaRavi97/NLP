The argument revolves around whether all human actions are inherently selfish. One side argues that selfishness is a basic survival instinct, coloring all actions with self-interest. For example, one might help others partly out of consideration for oneself, such as a lifeguard who saves to perform well in their job, or individuals who may gain from a self-sacrifice by leaving a legacy.

Conversely, there are claims of truly selfless acts, such as giving one's life, which cannot be selfish as the individual gains nothing material. However, this is countered with arguments that even such acts avoid personal conscience suffering, have financial motives, or are driven by biological imperatives like protecting one's children for genetic continuation. Additionally, self-destructive behaviors are mentioned as neither selfish nor unselfish.

Others posit that feeling pleasure from good deeds or adherence to cultural or religious norms, often with promised rewards, cannot be separated from self-interest, while some contend that cooperative behavior or selflessness taught by cultural norms may override selfish instincts.

Overall, the discussion highlights complex motivations behind human actions, suggesting a spectrum rather than a binary classification of selfishness.
