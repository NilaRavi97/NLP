The argument over the existence of ghosts presents a multifaceted debate. Proponents cite cultural beliefs in ghosts across numerous societies and unexplained phenomena that some attribute to paranormal activity. They argue that the absence of proof is not proof of absence and mention quantum physics theories that suggest ghosts could be perceivable energy remnants. Skeptics counter by highlighting the lack of scientific evidence for ghosts, noting that many claims are based on faulty personal anecdotes or hysteria, which do not constitute reliable evidence. They point out that the human brain can hallucinate reality, and that mental illness can cause ghostly sensations. Moreover, the frequent portrayal of ghosts in entertainment as fiction and the lack of acceptance by mainstream religions are argued to further weaken the claim that ghosts are real.
