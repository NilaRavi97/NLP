The discussion on school shootings examines the role of psychosocial factors versus gun control, indicating that while factors like isolation, mental health, and abuse are relevant, there isn't a direct link between mental illness and mass shootings. The debate calls for nuanced solutions that address both psychosocial issues and gun laws, with an emphasis on further research to better predict who might commit such crimes. Not all individuals with psychosocial problems become shooters, highlighting that these issues alone cannot fully explain the occurrence of mass shootings.
