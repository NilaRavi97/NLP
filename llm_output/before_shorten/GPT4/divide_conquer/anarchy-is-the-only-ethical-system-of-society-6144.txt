In a debate about government's necessity, proponents emphasized its essential role in maintaining order and providing services, though admitting the risk of tyranny. Discussions highlighted the balance between personal freedoms and communal duties, especially in medical matters, and acknowledged the challenge of defining individual wellbeing. The debate also considered the legitimacy of coercive actions in public health crises, such as enforcing quarantines, which despite pacifist views, were deemed defensible to protect public health and rights. An alternative view suggested that an anarchist society, with decentralized laws and horizontal organization, could maintain stability without centralized control.
