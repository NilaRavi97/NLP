The debate on drug legalization considered the pros of crime reduction and regulated use against cons of heightened addiction and child safety risks. While advocates stressed freedom and regulated benefits, opponents feared increased dependence. The distinction between less addictive hallucinogens, which inspired art and were part of 1960s culture, and harmful drugs like heroin was important. The potential for safely produced drugs under state control was discussed, and drugs' varied effects on performance were acknowledged. However, there was also a lament for the cultural loss due to drug-related artist fatalities.
