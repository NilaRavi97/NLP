The debate on implementing a flat asset tax is contentious with advocates praising its simplicity and fairness while critics raise concerns about discouraging investment, enforcement difficulties, and the potential to exacerbate inequality and unfairly target those with inherited wealth. There are fears of job losses in the tax advisory sector and debates over government control versus liberty principles. Supporters argue for equalizing the tax on income from both active work and passive investments, highlighting the need for incentives for active income generation.
