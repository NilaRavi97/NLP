The debate on constructed languages (conlangs) centers on their benefits in fostering creativity and innovation versus their practicality and cognitive impact. Advocates highlight conlangs' role in linguistic knowledge expansion and artistic uses, as seen in fictional languages like Klingon and Dothraki. Critics argue that natural languages and translation technologies suffice, referencing the decline of Sanskrit with its constructed elements as a potential cautionary tale. Some insist languages inherently evolve as social constructs, echoing Chomsky's innate grammar theories. While skepticism remains, particularly about conlangs' mainstream adoption, their unique grammars and niche applications persist in various domains.
