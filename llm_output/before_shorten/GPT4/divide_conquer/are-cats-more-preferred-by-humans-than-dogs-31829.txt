The debate compares the suitability of cats versus dogs as pets, with preferences often depending on one's lifestyle. Independent individuals might prefer cats, while those with an active lifestyle may choose dogs. Dogs are considered to bond more closely with humans, reflected in both their popularity (63% of pet owners) and higher oxytocin levels during interaction compared to cats (43% of owners). However, the understanding of cat affection might be misjudged. Cat allergies also influence pet choice, being more common than dog allergies. Cost-wise, cats are generally cheaper to care for, with lower initial and boarding expenses than dogs.
