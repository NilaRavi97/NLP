The debate presents contrasting perspectives on unions. Advocates argue unions are essential for improving worker safety, fair wages, and may collaborate with employers for better training, safety, and competitiveness. On the other side, critics highlight issues with union efficiency, corruption, potential market disruptions, and advocate for individual responsibility in training and development. Studies show union members often earn more, despite paying dues. In the public sector, there's criticism of unions for creating imbalances of power. The quality of union leadership is emphasized as a determinant of union effectiveness. Meanwhile, the overall impact of unions on power dynamics within capitalism is contested; some see unions as protectors against worker exploitation, while violence during union activities is noted, typically committed by management forces.
