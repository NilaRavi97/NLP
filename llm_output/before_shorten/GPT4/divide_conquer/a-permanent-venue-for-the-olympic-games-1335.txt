The debate on a permanent Olympic venue in Greece includes arguments for cost reduction and tourism growth, versus concerns about reduced cultural diversity and unequal benefits. Alternatives like rotating venues or an Olympic Island face issues of unity and corruption. Greece's economy and inclusivity are also factors. Some suggest separate permanent venues for Summer and Winter Olympics, with possible candidates like Switzerland, while others stress the Olympicsâ€™ need for global diversity, unlike fixed-location events such as the Tour de France and Wimbledon.
