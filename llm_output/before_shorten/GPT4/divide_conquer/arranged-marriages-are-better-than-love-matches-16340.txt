The debate highlighted the contrasts between arranged and love marriages, focusing on cultural compatibility and family support for arranged marriages versus personal choice in love marriages. Arranged marriages can lead to pressure and potential misrepresentation, while love marriages may face family tensions. Both types require a balance between personal desires and family expectations, with the challenge of maintaining a partner's choice daily. Critics argue that expecting consistent daily choice in love marriages overlooks the reality of fluctuating marital satisfaction.
