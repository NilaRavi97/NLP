The debate considers soap bars and shower gels, focusing on the environmental friendliness and cost-effectiveness of soap bars versus the hygiene, versatility, and convenience of shower gels. Soap bars use less packaging and are viewed as better for the environment, whereas shower gels are favored for shared bathrooms and eye irritation-free hair washing, albeit they can still cause eye irritation and are seen as more modern. Soap bars may leave residue in hair but can work for short hair, while shower gels come in plastic packaging that contributes to environmental harm.
