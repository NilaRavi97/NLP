The EU is working towards an Energy Union to reduce dependence on Russian energy, while Russia is looking east due to Western sanctions. Ukraine's NATO membership is debated, highlighting the region's need for diverse energy sources and military alliances against Russian dominance. The US backs Ukraineâ€™s NATO integration, while some allies, notably Germany, are cautious. Meanwhile, Putin faces domestic pressure and declining approval ratings, now at his lowest since 2006, impacted by sanctions and showing a decline in public support from 75% to 58%. In addition, the Russian government's propaganda campaigns challenge Western narratives, fostering domestic skepticism towards foreign media, with only 7% of Russians favoring information from foreign websites. Russian media has been key in framing conflicts in Syria, the Skripal poisoning, and the 2008 Georgia intervention, aligning public sentiment with the state's position.
