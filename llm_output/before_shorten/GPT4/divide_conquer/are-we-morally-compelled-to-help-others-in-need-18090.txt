The debate centers on whether helping others is a moral obligation. Advocates claim it builds cooperative societies and aligns with ethical standards, implying positive returns such as karma. Critics challenge this, citing morality's subjectivity, personal self-interest, and potential exploitation arising from altruism. The dialogue touches on Korea's Saemaul Undong as an example of the benefits of cooperation. The debate also distinguishes logical from ethical truths, suggesting the former can guide moral choices. Opponents' view of altruism leading to atrocities is countered with the failure to help effectively, not the non-existence of a moral duty to help.
