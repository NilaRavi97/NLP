The debate explores the consequences of labeling individuals as immoral, from the potential to deter bad actions to the negative impact on personal reform. It discusses the fluidity and subjectivity of morality, considering whether ignorance can justify moral lapses and how genuine ignorance is hard to discern from pretense. The discoursers acknowledge that while some actions stem from a lack of moral insight, this does not absolve individuals from responsibility, even though external challenges can make moral behavior more difficult. The conversation also looks at the efficacy of the penal system and the importance of moral education in children.
