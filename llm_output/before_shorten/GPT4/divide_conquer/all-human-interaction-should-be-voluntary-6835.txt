The debate centered on the impact of automation on jobs and how policy should respond. Discussions included the application of the Non-Aggression Principle to non-violent crime management and the advantages of limited government to reduce state intervention and taxation, deemed by some as theft. Concerns were raised about the effectiveness of limited government in handling complex crimes and the risk of unchecked market forces leading to oppression. Participants suggested civil courts could resolve contract and monopoly issues. However, skepticism existed about the adequacy of minimal state mechanisms for defense and law enforcement without traditional funding methods like taxation.
