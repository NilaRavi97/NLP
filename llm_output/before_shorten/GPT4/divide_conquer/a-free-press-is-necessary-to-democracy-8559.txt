The debate centered around the critical role of a free press in democracies for ensuring accountability and informed voting, contrasted with issues like sensationalism, bias, and misinformation. There was support for some regulation to enforce journalistic integrity, but also belief in the press's capacity for self-correction. Challenges mentioned included media being influenced by powerful owners and the potential spread of harmful content. While some argued that press freedom isn't essential for democracy as voters aren't required to be educated about current affairs, others countered that an unbiased press is crucial for rational decision-making at the polls.
