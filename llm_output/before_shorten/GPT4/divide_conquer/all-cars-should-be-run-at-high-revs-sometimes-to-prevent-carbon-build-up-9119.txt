Supporters of "Italian tuning" endorse high RPM engine revving to clean carbon deposits, with some mechanics backing this practice. However, opponents caution against potential damage and note modern cars often don't suffer from carbon buildup. They suggest alternative maintenance methods and highlight the absence of such advice in car manuals. While less relevant for diesel engines like VW Passat 2.0 TDI, which clears carbon at sustained lower RPMs, diesel engines with a DPF benefit from higher temperatures to burn soot. The method also raises concerns about increased accident and fatality risks due to high-speed driving.
