The debate compared free markets to regulated markets, focusing on the balance between consumer choice and innovation versus the need to address inequality and environmental issues. Supporters of free markets touted their benefits, whereas opponents raised concerns about resulting disparities and monopolies, particularly referring to historical examples like the US Gilded Age. Pro-regulation arguments emphasized service delivery and monopoly prevention, although critics argued regulation might stifle competition and favor established firms. The consensus stressed the importance of finding a middle ground that ensures public welfare without compromising economic vibrancy, while acknowledging that not all monopolies are due to government action.
