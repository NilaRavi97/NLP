The debate on ATC privatization reveals a divide: proponents cite potential for efficiency and technological improvements based on successes in countries like Canada, advocating for adaptability and focused investment. Critics counter with concerns over safety, maintaining current effectiveness, financial risks, and potential for inequality in service provision. They worry privatization may result in higher costs and compromised safety due to airlines choosing less costly ATC options. The Canadian example's relevance is acknowledged but questions remain whether its success can be replicated in the US context.
