Supporters of high football transfer fees argue they provide fair compensation to clubs for developing talent and help maintain financial balance, including benefits for smaller clubs. Opponents view these fees as extravagant, citing global poverty and risks of corruption and financial instability, as exemplified by the Neyreyes case. They propose investment in infrastructure or lower ticket prices instead. Critics also believe the system unduly favors agents and rich clubs, potentially leading to inflated egos and player pressure. However, transfer fees are seen as compensation for premature contract termination, with the price reflecting various contractual factors. Critics call for fiscal reforms within football.
