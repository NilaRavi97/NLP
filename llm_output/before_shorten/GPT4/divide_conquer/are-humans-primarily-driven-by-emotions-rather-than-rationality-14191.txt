The debate centers on whether human behavior is mostly driven by emotions or rationality. Emotional proponents point to its strong impact on decisions and susceptibility to populism, while rationality supporters cite its importance in progress and economic models like the Phillips curve. Instances like the post-9/11 invasion illustrate a mix of both forces. Though rationality is esteemed for scientific achievements, emotions are seen to often dominate, influenced by scenarios like the trolley problem and emotion-based advertising. It's acknowledged that self-consciousness and rational thought exist, yet emotions are typically seen as the primary driver of human behavior.
