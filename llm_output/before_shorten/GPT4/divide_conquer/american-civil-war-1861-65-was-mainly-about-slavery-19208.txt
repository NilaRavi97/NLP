The American Civil War had multiple causes including the central issue of slavery, Southern secession, economic disputes, and state authority. Cultural divides were highlighted by the South's rejection of the Corwin Amendment, despite it allowing slavery. Arguments that technology would have ended slavery are refuted by its persistence in Union states. Economic tensions arose from the Tariff of 1828, contributing to the Southern secession. Although emancipation became a war objective, slavery was not immediately abolished in all areas, even after the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation.
