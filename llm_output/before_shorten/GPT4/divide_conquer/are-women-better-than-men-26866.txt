The debate examined various factors influencing gender disparities in crime rates, work-related deaths, and life expectancy, such as masculinity-associated traits (competitiveness and aggression) and childhood adversity impacting boys more severely. Educational discrepancies were discussed, acknowledging women's higher graduation rates due to social factors. Gender differences in reproductive aging were also addressed, noting earlier menopause and fertility decline for women despite IVF accessibility. The argument regarding physical achievements highlighted that while women have matched men in extreme feats, such as space travel and endurance races, this demonstrates equality, not superiority, as women's weightlifting records still lag behind men's.
