The debate contrasts Milankovitch Cycles and human activities as drivers of current climate change. Critics highlight that the swift climate change observed is consistent with human-induced CO2 emissions. Satellite data bolsters this anthropogenic cause, rather than solar variations. Historically, Milankovitch Cycles influenced climate, but the prevailing view is that human actions are now the dominant force, pushing the climate off its natural cooling path. The discussion notes complexities in measuring solar output and acknowledges scientific constraints in ascertaining definitive causes. "TSI" refers to Total Solar Irradiance, a measure of solar energy.
