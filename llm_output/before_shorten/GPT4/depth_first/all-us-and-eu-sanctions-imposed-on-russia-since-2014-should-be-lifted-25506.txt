Sanctions on Russia, implemented since 2014 due to its actions in Ukraine, have sparked debate regarding their impact. Proponents argue that sanctions pressure the Russian government, target oligarchs who support Putin, and are a justified response to international law violations. Critics contend that sanctions harm Russian citizens more than the state, bolster Putinâ€™s domestic support, and have not achieved political change in Russia. They also cause economic damage to the US and EU and create tensions within these blocs. Conversely, the sanctions have led to some economic adjustments in Russia, like cutting military spending, and have made Russian oligarchs less dependent on the West. While some argue for lifting sanctions to diminish international tensions and encourage peace, others believe retaining them sends a message against aggression and supports Ukraine against Russian expansionism.
