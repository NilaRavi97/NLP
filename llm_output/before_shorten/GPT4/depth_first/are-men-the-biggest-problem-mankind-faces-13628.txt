The debate explores whether men are the primary problem in society. One side argues that men, while causing societal ills, are essential due to their roles in important services, possibly due to natural gender capabilities. The other side suggests that institutionalized sexism and the different biological tendencies between sexes shape these roles. While men's physical strength and risk-taking are noted, some argue that blaming men overlooks systemic issues and individual differences, as power dynamics affect both genders. Additionally, the influence of upbringing, religion, and culture on gender roles is discussed, with varying opinions on whether education or cultural shifts can drive change and whether religion will diminish over time. The complexity of gender interactions and societal structures is highlighted, suggesting that the issue is multifaceted and not solely attributable to men as a group.
