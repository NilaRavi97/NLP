The debate addresses whether real estate brokers are still necessary in contemporary society given the availability of technology and alternative methods for buying and selling property. Proponents of brokers argue that their expertise, knowledge of market trends, and skills in staging and presenting properties justify the commission fees they earn. Critics, however, contend that technology offers sufficient tools for buyers and sellers to handle transactions independently, and that brokers' fees are excessive for the services provided. They also suggest that the reliance on brokers perpetuates outdated practices and potential conflicts of interest. Some argue that high-value transactions still require professional assistance, while others believe that the role of brokers could be streamlined or that government legislation could render traditional brokerage services obsolete. Ultimately, the discussion hinges on whether the traditional brokerage model offers added value commensurate with its costs, or whether new technologies and service structures could replace or reform it.
