Debate surrounds the proposal for the IOC to establish a permanent Olympic venue. Advocates argue such a venue would eliminate negative press on host countries, reduce distractions, and ensure optimal conditions for athletes, citing difficulties in past events like Beijing's pollution or Rio's heat. Moreover, it would help avoid the corruption and cost overruns common in the bidding process and the construction of temporary venues. Opponents contend it would unfairly benefit one nation, lose the cultural showcase of rotating hosts, could lead to an underused facility incurring high maintenance, and diverts from the Olympics' spirit of international rotation and inclusivity. They suggest other income models and stress that problems like overspending and corruption could be addressed without compromising the tradition and excitement of global host rotation. Potential solutions like rotating venues among continents or a neutral location like Greece are weighed against issues such as infrastructure cost burdens and socio-political risks.
