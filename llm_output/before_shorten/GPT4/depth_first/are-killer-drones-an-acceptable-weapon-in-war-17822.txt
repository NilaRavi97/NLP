Killer drones are a controversial topic in warfare. Proponents argue they minimize military casualties and provide precise targeting, reducing collateral damage. They also note that drones are cost-effective and put pressure on terrorist organizations due to constant surveillance. On the other hand, critics claim drones lead to increased fatalities and lower accountability, potentially making conflict more likely. There are concerns about an arms race and the disadvantage for countries with inferior technology. Furthermore, while drones reduce risks to soldiers, drone operators may still suffer psychological trauma. Ethical implications of distancing from the battlefield, the potential rise in civilian casualties, and the ability to interrogate captured terrorists are other criticisms. Despite these issues, some argue that technological superiority in warfare has historically aligned with advancements in human rights.
