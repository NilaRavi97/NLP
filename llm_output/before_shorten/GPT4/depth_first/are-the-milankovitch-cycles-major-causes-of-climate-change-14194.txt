Debate participants discussed the role of the Milankovitch Cycles and human activities in climate change. They agreed that while the Milankovitch Cycles contribute to natural climatic shifts over thousands to millions of years, they cannot account for the rapid warming observed in recent decades. The Sunâ€™s influence was considered minor in the contemporary context; solar data from satellites since the 1970s do not show significant brightening corresponding to the warming trend. Participants pointed out inconsistencies in attributing primary cause and noted that human-made CO2 is a much faster driver of climate change. Some skepticism was expressed about precise correlation between Milankovitch Cycles and historic climate patterns, with calls for clearer scientific evidence, and discussions on the limitations of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) as a measurement.
