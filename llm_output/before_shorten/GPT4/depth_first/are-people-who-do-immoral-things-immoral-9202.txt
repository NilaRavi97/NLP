The debate centers on whether performing immoral acts makes an individual inherently immoral and the potential for change. Some argue that morality is subjective and individuals are capable of change, so labeling them as permanently immoral is unfair. Others believe that committing immoral acts, by definition, renders a person immoral, but this does not necessarily mean they cannot be reformed, highlighting that morality can evolve over time. Concerns about negative social consequences, such as increased suicide rates or deterioration of mental health from being branded immoral, are contrasted with the notion that such outcomes do not validate or invalidate the underlying moral beliefs. The effectiveness of imprisonment as a response to immorality is questioned, with perspectives differing on recidivism and the nature of corrective facilities. Additionally, the debate touches on whether lack of self-control or ignorance justify immoral actions, and whether difficulty in performing good acts exempts behavior from moral judgment.
