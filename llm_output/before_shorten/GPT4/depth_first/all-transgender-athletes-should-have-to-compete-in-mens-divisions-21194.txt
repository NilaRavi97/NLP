The debate centers on whether transgender athletes should compete in gendered sports categories. Proponents argue that male-to-female transgender athletes who did not experience male puberty could compete with women; otherwise, they should compete with men. They suggest considering ability or weight class instead of gender and that excluding transgender children can lead to bullying. Opponents stress biological advantages like bone structure, muscle mass, and spatial awareness that transgender females might retain, advocating for rigid standards based on biology, suggesting that testosterone levels alone do not erase these advantages. They also contend that the competitive integrity for groups outweighs individual desires.
