The debate revolves around the principle that all human interaction should be voluntary, suggesting a society based on voluntarism and the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP). Proponents argue that such a society would honor free will, foster respectful and non-coercive relationships, reduce government oppression, empower marginalized groups, and potentially reduce crime, with voluntary court systems handling disputes. On the other hand, critics assert that not all human interaction is or can be voluntary, pointing to situations like taxes, citizenship, and social development needs. They also highlight potential issues such as the challenge of enforcing laws, protecting minorities, and whether voluntarism is realistic or even beneficial for all segments of society. There are concerns about how to tackle societal issues like pollution and corruption, manage foreign threats, and build infrastructure without some form of taxation or centralized governance.
