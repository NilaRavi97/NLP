Privatization of the US Air Traffic Control (ATC) is debated, with concerns that private companies would prioritize profit, leading to safety issues and higher charges. Supporters like airlines and controllers' union point to the success in other countries, such as Canada, and the need for faster technology upgrades. Critics argue that government management ensures equitable treatment and safety, highlighting the US's lead in ATC technology and complexity. They stress that the current publicly-funded system has worked well for over a century, and the cost and effort to privatize the highly complicated system would divert funds from other modernization needs.
