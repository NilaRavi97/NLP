The debate centers on whether humans are primarily driven by emotions or by rationality. On one hand, society's overall rational actions, like those related to economics and geopolitical strategies, suggest individual rationality. Market anomalies and historical decisions, like going to war, however, often reflect emotional influences. While structures like governments function on rationality, individuals frequently exhibit emotional decision-making as evident in thought experiments like the trolley problem. Populism also showcases our susceptibility to emotional persuasion. Yet, rational thought is undeniable, given scientific progress and evolution towards self-consciousness. This suggests a continuous interplay between emotion and rationality in human behavior.
