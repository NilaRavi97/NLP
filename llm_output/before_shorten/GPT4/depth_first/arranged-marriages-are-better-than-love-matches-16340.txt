Arranged marriages are debated for being better or worse than love marriages. Proponents argue that the arbitrary nature of finding "true" love is equivalent to having a partner chosen for you. Others stress the benefits of shared parental and cultural values. Critics, however, highlight the risk of abuse, lack of personal agency, and forced conformity, mentioning high abuse rates in countries like India where arranged marriages are common. They advocate personal choice, emphasizing the importance of love and compatibility, the learning experiences from relationships, and the dangers of basing a lifelong commitment on factors other than mutual affection. Ultimately, there are arguments for the stability provided by arranged marriage practices versus the individual freedoms associated with love marriages.
