Purity pledges, commitments to abstain from sex until marriage, spark contentious debate. Proponents argue they offer a counter-narrative to hypersexualization, providing support and empowering individuals—especially women—to control their sexuality against societal pressure. Critics contend that these pledges perpetuate harmful stereotypes and tie self-worth to virginity. They assert that pledges made by uninformed young people can lead to feelings of shame, guilt, and a lack of sexual agency. While abstinence is effective birth control and may prevent some negative health outcomes associated with casual sex, purity pledges are criticized for their role in stigmatizing sexual activity, contributing to misinformation about sexuality and contraceptives, and potentially increasing the risks of unprotected sex and sexual violence. Furthermore, these pledges are considered largely ineffective, with most ultimately not adhered to, and are deemed as limiting the comprehensive understanding of sexual health, rights, and education.
