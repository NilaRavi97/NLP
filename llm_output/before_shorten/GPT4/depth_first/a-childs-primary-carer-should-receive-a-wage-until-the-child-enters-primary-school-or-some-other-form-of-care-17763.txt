The debate centers around whether a primary carer should receive a government wage until the child reaches primary school age. Advocates argue that it might aid low-income families, combat low population growth, and acknowledge child-rearing as valuable work. Critics counter that this could lead to government meddling in parenting, incentivize having children for money—potentially causing overpopulation—and that child-rearing does not generate direct economic value. Additionally, it's suggested that societal responsibility rather than state support should be the norm, and that this policy may not be economically sustainable, though existing models like Germany's child allowance indicate feasibility.
