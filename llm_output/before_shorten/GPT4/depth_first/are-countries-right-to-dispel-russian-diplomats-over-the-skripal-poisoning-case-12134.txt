Countries have expelled Russian diplomats in response to the Skripal poisoning, asserting Russia's likely responsibility, despite not having conclusive independent analysis from the OPCW. The UK argues this action is a stance against Putin's regime and demonstrates Western unity. Critics argue that it's illegitimate to prioritize collective Western interests over individual national interests and due process. The UK's refusal to share a nerve agent sample with Russia and the absence of discussion on the matter between Trump and Putin are highlighted. There is a concern that escalating tensions could lead to war, while the UK cites evidence of Russia stockpiling nerve agents for assassinations.
