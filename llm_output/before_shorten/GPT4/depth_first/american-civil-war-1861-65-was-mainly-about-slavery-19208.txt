The debate hinges on the central cause of the American Civil War. One side argues that the war was primarily about the North preserving the Union and not exclusively motivated by opposition to slavery, citing that slavery still existed in some Union states during the war. The other side points to Southern states' declarations, which explicitly mention slavery as a key reason for secession. While economic factors like tariffs and regional power in Congress were at play, the spread and preservation of slavery was a significant point of contention between North and South, with cultural divisions and state rights as additional factors. President Lincoln's actions during the war, including the revocation of emancipation proclamations by generals, indicate that the emancipation of slaves was leveraged as a strategic measure.
