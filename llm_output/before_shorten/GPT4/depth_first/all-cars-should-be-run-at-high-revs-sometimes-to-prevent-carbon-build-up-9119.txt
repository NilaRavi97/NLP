The debate centers around whether high-rev driving is necessary to prevent carbon buildup in cars. Proponents argue that driving at high RPMs can burn off carbon due to increased temperatures. They mention that some mechanics recommend it and that certain car manuals, like the VW Passat 2.0 TDI diesel, advise driving at moderate to high RPMs to assist with Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) maintenance. Opponents counter that high-rev driving is risky and potentially fatal, citing the high number of road deaths. They also argue that it can damage the vehicle, modern cars don't typically have carbon buildup issues, and that there are more efficient maintenance methods. Additionally, there is contention on whether this practice applies to both gasoline and diesel engines.
