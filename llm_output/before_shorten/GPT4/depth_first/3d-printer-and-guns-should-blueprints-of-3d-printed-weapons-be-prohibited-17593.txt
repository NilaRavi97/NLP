The debate centers around whether 3D-printed gun blueprints should be banned from publication online. Proponents of the ban argue that 3D printing could allow individuals ineligible to purchase guns to access them, circumventing existing laws like the Undetectable Firearms Act. They add that these guns are untraceable and undetectable, suggesting a ban could limit their proliferation. Opponents claim such a ban is unconstitutional, citing the First Amendment and comparing blueprints to other controversial but legal information like the "Anarchist's Cookbook." They argue that blueprints themselves are not direct threats, making prevention pointless, and that 3D-printed guns require technical knowledge that limits their accessibility. They also emphasize that making guns for personal use is legal, suggesting 3D printing is just another method for lawful gun creation.
