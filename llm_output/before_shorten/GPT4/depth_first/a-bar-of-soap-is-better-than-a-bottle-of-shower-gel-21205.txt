The debate compares bar soap and shower gel, highlighting the hygienic advantage of shower gel in a shared environment but criticizing its environmental impact due to excessive plastic packaging and inefficiency in transport. While shower gel is considered more modern, bar soap is seen as more convenient, longer-lasting, uses less packaging, and is cheaper. Contrary points include the discomfort of using bar soap for hair washing and the potential for both soap and gel to sting eyes. The mention of bar soap being easy to drop suggests a minor inconvenience compared to its benefits.
