Modern democracies have varying levels of success, largely dependent on the quality of their institutions and adaptability. Some thrive due to evolution, such as New Zealand's shift to proportional representation, while others struggle with centralized power in presidential systems. Democracies face criticism for being slow to change and over-relying on representative models, potentially leading to agility issues in governance. Despite less than half of world countries being deemed "free," democracy has spread significantly over the last century, evolving into mixed governments with elements of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. Critics highlight that elected officials are often unrepresentative of the general populace and that wealth can vastly influence politics. Nonetheless, democracies typically are richer, promote freedom, and hold mechanisms for adaptation and self-correction. They balance freedom with the rule of law but grapple with inherent unfairness, such as blasphemy laws in places like Italy. Democracies can prevent civil strife by allowing electoral change, but maintaining civil conflict resolution remains a challenge. The system often faces criticism for populism and the influence of poor or uninformed voter participation, yet at its core, democracy strives to engage the collective wisdom through education and participation, leveraging technology for advancement. Despite its vulnerabilities, democracy's resilience and ability to self-correct position it as a widely supported system of governance.
