The debate addresses whether human actions are inherently selfish. Some argue that self-preservation and the fulfillment of personal needs or desires point to an underlying selfishness in our actions, even when we help others or practice self-sacrifice. For instance, a lifeguard saving someone or parents protecting their children can be interpreted as fulfilling one's job requirements or genetic inclination to preserve offspring. Others contend that true selflessness exists when people give their lives for others or engage in altruistic deeds without tangible rewards. Motivations for actions considered selfless, such as charity or religious acts, are scrutinized; even good deeds driven by empathy or cultural norms might have self-centered motives like pursuing a positive self-image or complying to avoid social persecution. Ultimately, the debate suggests that while selfishness may be an evolutionary instinct, cultural and rational influences can foster cooperation and altruistic behavior.
