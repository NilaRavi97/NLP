Constructed languages are a topic of debate, with opinions divided on their necessity and utility. Advocates argue that they are useful for technology and creative learning, and can foster understanding of linguistic structures. Some believe constructed languages, with their logical structures, can simplify learning and aid in international communication. Critics, however, contend that constructed languages waste time because they require substantial learning effort, often without practical benefit, as natural languages already serve communication needs well. Translation apps, while imperfect, have proven useful, though reliant on internet connectivity. The success of constructed languages like Klingon and Dothraki shows potential, but widespread adoption and utility remain limited.
