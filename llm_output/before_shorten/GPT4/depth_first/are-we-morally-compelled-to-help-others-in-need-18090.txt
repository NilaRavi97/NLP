Debate centers on the moral obligation to help others and the nature of altruism. Proponents argue that cooperation and helping others are natural human behaviors, beneficial for society, and endorsed by various belief systems. Critics assert that altruism could be detrimental to oneself and has led to historical atrocities justified by utilitarianism. They question the logical basis for self-sacrifice when it doesn't serve personal gain. The debate also touches upon the philosophies of morality, consequentialism, and the interpretations of what is 'right,' suggesting that a moral duty to help is separate from the success of such actions.
