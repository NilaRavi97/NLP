The debate on legalizing all drugs includes arguments for legitimacy in drug policy, natural human behavior, cultural and religious practices, scientific research benefits, and potential harm reduction. Proponents argue that current laws are irrational and legalization could reduce violence and corruption while respecting individual choice and advancing medical research. Critics warn of increased accessibility leading to greater drug use, especially among minors, the potential for drugs to be abused in crimes like date rape, and exacerbation of issues in vulnerable communities. Legalization might shift profits from cartels to government, aiding public services, but could also lead to corporate exploitation. Some argue that legal regulation can ensure safety and quality, and education could promote responsible use. Evidence from places like Portugal shows potential benefits, yet concerns about societal impacts and protection of minors remain strong.
