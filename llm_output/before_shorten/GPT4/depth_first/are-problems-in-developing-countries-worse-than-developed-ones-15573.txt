Developing countries face compounded issues including high poverty rates, vulnerability during emergencies, and weaker state support systems. Despite receiving aid, they often struggle with debt repayments and economic isolation. Although their citizens work long hours, benefits from developed countries are viewed as investments. Problems in developed countries, such as gentrification and public health issues linked to Western lifestyle, may transfer to developing nations during their transition. Additionally, developing countries deal with legacies of colonialism, debt crises, and systemic corruption. Global challenges like climate change disproportionately affect them due to limited resources to combat the fallout. Consequently, problems in the developing world are deemed more severe due to a combination of internal struggles and external pressures that they face in addition to the global issues that affect all nations.
