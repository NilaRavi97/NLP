The debate centers on whether dating sites should implement background checks. Proponents argue that background checks would enhance online dating safety by filtering out married individuals and potential criminals, potentially leading to a higher success rate of relationships progressing to marriage, especially for paid platforms. Critics, however, raise concerns about personal data security and the risk of cyber attacks given dating sites' questionable cybersecurity records. It's suggested that background checks be mandatory for paid sites and optional for free ones. Opponents also warn that such measures might increase membership costs, reduce user base as some may resist the intrusion, and possibly decrease site revenue.
