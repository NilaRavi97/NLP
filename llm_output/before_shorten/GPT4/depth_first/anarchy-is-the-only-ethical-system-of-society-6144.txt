The debate centers on the ethical justification of anarchy versus government. Proponents of anarchy argue that it is the only ethical system, asserting that government coercion is unethical and individual freedom paramount. They maintain that people naturally act ethically and can form voluntary associations for mutual benefit and protection, without the need for government. Opponents argue that anarchy could lead to sociopathic violence and power imbalances, and that governments, despite their coercive nature, provide necessary functions such as upholding justice and national defense. The role of governments in taxation, protection of weak and vulnerable individuals, environmental issues, and large-scale cooperative endeavors is discussed. Some contend that anarchy might work in small populations but is impractical and ethically dubious on a larger scale due to its instability and inability to guarantee rights and justice.
