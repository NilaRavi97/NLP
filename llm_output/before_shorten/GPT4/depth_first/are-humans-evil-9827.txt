The debate addresses whether humans are inherently evil, with arguments pointing to human-caused deaths, subjective morality, self-interest motivations, empathy, environmental influences, and psychological tendencies. Some posit that humans are naturally evil because they cause harm and can be self-serving, while others argue that 'evil' is a social construct, not an inherent property. Additional arguments suggest humans have free will and possess traits for empathy and altruism that counter claims of inherent evilness. It's also highlighted that personality traitsâ€”including those linked to psychopathy or sadism, are not predominant in all humans, suggesting that 'evil' behaviors are exceptions rather than the rule. Furthermore, 'evil' actions can be driven by survival, self-defense, or lack of knowledge rather than malicious intent. The concept of evil is subjective and culturally defined, with opinions divided over humanity's moral baseline.
