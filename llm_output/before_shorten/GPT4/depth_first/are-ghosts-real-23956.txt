The debate argues whether ghosts are real, with one side citing a lack of scientific evidence and the possibility of psychological explanations, while the other suggests that widespread cultural beliefs and unexplained phenomena indicate the possibility of their existence. Critics argue that personal anecdotes and the desire for attention can lead to biased reporting of ghost sightings, and that experiences attributed to ghosts might instead be hallmarks of mental illness or other logical fallacies. Moreover, no consistent definition of a ghost exists, making it difficult to establish what constitutes proof. Some argue that phenomena often labeled as "paranormal" may have physical explanations yet to be understood by science, drawing parallels with how gravity was eventually explained. Conversely, the prevalence of ghosts in entertainment is dismissed as not discrediting belief in ghosts, and video evidence is often deemed unreliable or manipulated. Mainstream religions are also mentioned, with some not acknowledging ghosts, further complicating the debate.
