Discussion Title: Are Ghosts Real?

1. Ghosts aren't real.
1.1. Con: Scientifically, ghosts are neuro-psychological, cultural and sociological phenomenon that have been studied in many ways and can be reproduced like the research done by [Michael Persinger](https://www.nature.com/news/2004/041206/full/041206-10.html).
1.2. Pro: There is no scientific proof that ghosts are real.
1.2.1. Con: Much of science, like physics and a physical cosmology, is based on conjecture backed by stats and probabilities. The word proof is therefore a movable definition.'
1.2.2. Con: There has yet to be an [agreed](https://www.livescience.com/26697-are-ghosts-real.html) upon definition for ghosts, therefore without this agreement, they cannot yet agree upon what is/is not proof.
1.2.3. Pro: Many who claim to have seen ghosts [aren't sure](https://www.livescience.com/26697-are-ghosts-real.html) it was in fact a ghost they've seen.
1.2.4. Pro: Claims of ghost sightings are based on personal anectdotes.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Personal anecdote is [not a reliable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence#Faulty_logic) form of evidence; it has a high probability of being faulty.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: "Spotting" a ghost, which has never been proven to exist, could bring the observer a certain measure of reputation and public buzz. It's possible the want for popularity can elicit unreliable information.
1.2.4.2. Con: If enough people have claimed to see the same ghost, anecdotal evidence is valuable.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: If people are aware that location "x" is said to contain a ghost with "x" description, it is likely that their paranoia and eagerness to spot said ghost would cause a biased perception and influence them to belief natural occurrences as unnatural ones.
1.2.4.2.2. Con: Hysteria does not make something real.
1.2.5. Con: There is no scientific proof that ghosts aren't real.
1.2.5.1. Con: If something hasn't been found yet, it does not mean, that it doesn't exist.
1.2.5.2. Con: It is not possible to prove something doesn't exist.
1.2.6. Pro: Many movies, TV shows, video games, and books with ghosts in them are classified as fantasy, not as realistic fiction.
1.2.6.1. Pro: The 1984 movie [Ghostbusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters) is considered a supernatural comedy, not based in reality.
1.2.6.2. Con: The classification of something that is meant for entertainment purposes does not invalidate the existence of a phenomenon.
1.2.7. Con: There are many things humans have yet to understand, articulate, or find reason for. Such as the discovery of gravity, it is not a phenomenon we can see, but we see it's effects, and it has only been recent in human history we have been able to scientifically name it and identify it.
1.2.7.1. Con: Unlike paranormal phenomenon, the observed effects of gravity are measurable and predictable to the point that scientific laws have been established around them.
1.3. Con: Many different [cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost#By_culture) believe in ghosts.
1.3.1. Con: Belief is not evidence.
1.3.2. Pro: [African cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost#African_folklore), such as Igbo and Akan believe in ghosts.
1.3.3. Pro: [Bengali culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts_in_Bengali_culture) believes ghosts are spirits of the decease that have not found peace.
1.3.4. Pro: Many [European cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost#European_folklore) believe and ghosts, and even engage in practices such as [necromancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necromancy) to contact them.
1.3.5. Pro: For most cultures, the belief in ghosts were in place long before interacting with other cultures. Thus, it is likely ghosts exist if so many cultures experience them.
1.3.6. Con: There are also cultures that do not believe in ghosts.
1.3.6.1. Pro: [Atheists](https://www.thoughtco.com/atheism-incompatible-with-belief-in-souls-spirits-250441) in Western cultures, for example, may not believe in ghosts.
1.3.7. Con: It doesn't make the claim true.
1.3.7.1. Pro: A belief does not equate to something existing in reality.
1.3.7.2. Con: Widespread common beliefs indicates a common truth.
1.3.7.2.1. Con: Just because something is believed by a lot of people doesn't make it true. This is an ad populum fallacy.
1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.5. Pro: Experiencing the sensation of ghosts could be caused by mental illness.
1.5.1. Con: Observed reality could very well be made up for anyone. [Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyu7v7nWzfo)
1.5.2. Pro: [Mirror neurons,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5329044/) a common player in sleep paralysis, may to blame for seeing ghosts.

1.6. Con: There are sometimes strange phenomena that can't be explained in other ways.
1.6.1. Con: Attributing a strange phenomenon to being a ghost simply because we cannot explain it any other way does not mean it is absolutely a ghost. It means we are inconclusive in our findings and attaching a label, for lack of a better explanation.
1.6.2. Con: This is a logical fallacy called 'an argument from ignorance'. Lack of explanation does not warrant a claim for any explanation.
1.6.3. Con: 'There are many unexplained phenomena at one time. As technology progresses, the logical reasons for these phenomena become clear. The same may be true for what is perceived as ghosts.
1.6.4. Pro: Many people report seeing ghosts.
1.6.4.1. Con: Eye witness reports are unreliable as people's perception can be influenced by so many different factors.
1.6.4.2. Pro: [Eighteen percent](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/30/18-of-americans-say-theyve-seen-a-ghost/) of Americans report having seen ghosts.
1.6.5. Pro: There are many reported cases of [poltergeist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poltergeist#Famous_cases) activity.
1.7. Pro: Ghosts are simply energy left behind that humans can perceive, suggested by quantum physics.[ice.dartmouth.edu](https://ice.dartmouth.edu/blog/consciousness-quantum-physics-and-reality) [www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4068017/)
1.7.1. Pro: Humans have managed to store sounds on plastic discs, then replay them using very simple mechanisms. The "paranormal" could similarly be the effect of intense, or prolonged, events creating an imprint.
1.8. Con: There is video evidence of paranormal activity.
1.8.1. Con: There are accounts of people trying to contact ghosts that never receive any evidence.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Harry Houdini himself made a promise to his wife that, if there was any possible way for him to communicate with her following his death, he would [find it](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130890435). Even after consulting with numerous seances over the course of a decade, his wife never received his message.
1.8.2. Con: The nature of these videos cannot prove either, since they do not yield enough information to support any claim.
1.8.3. Con: The video qualities are often very bad and the sources are questionable.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Nowadays, a poor quality video can easily be edited to add things in, meaning that you can easily add a picture of a semi-transparent human.
1.8.4. Con: Most of the video "evidence" are [hoaxes](https://eu.azcentral.com/story/travel/arizona/2017/10/02/ghost-hunting-shows-fake/705566001/).
1.8.5. Pro: Docu-series such as [Ghost Adventures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Adventures) have accumulated years of unexplainable video footage.
1.8.5.1. Con: Ghost adventures is listed on imdb as a [science fiction show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1319900/).
1.8.5.2. Con: If video footage is unexplainable, then it stands to reason that the existence of ghosts may not be an explanation for that footage, since it cannot be explained.
1.8.5.3. Con: It is very easy to make things appear in video and photos that aren't really there \(an entertainment industry is built on it\). So video footage by itself isn't compelling evidence.
1.9. Pro: There is no mainstream religion that says ghosts are real.
1.9.1. Con: The world doesn't revolve around mainstream religion.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Not all phenomena are acknowledged or embraced by mainstream religions.
1.9.2. Pro: In [Christianity](https://www.christiantoday.com/article/can-you-be-a-christian-and-believe-in-ghosts/80411.htm), ghosts are not acknowledged.
1.9.3. Pro: The belief in ghosts is believed to [predate Islam](http://www.angelsghosts.com/ghosts_islam). They are considered a superstition.
