Discussion Title: Are gender and sex the same thing?

1. Should gender and sex be the same thing?
1.1. Pro: Gender and sex are already the same thing.
1.1.1. Con: Sex is biological but gender is psychological.
1.1.1.1. Pro: [Biological sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_gender_distinction) refers to the anatomy of an individual's reproductive system, and secondary sex characteristics. Gender can refer to either social roles based on the sex of the person \(gender role\) or personal identification of one's own gender based on an internal awareness \(gender identity\).
1.1.2. Pro: Sex and gender are used interchangeably by many people already
1.1.2.1. Con: Just because "many people" use them interchangeably does not mean that they are the same
1.1.2.2. Pro: [Some languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_gender_distinction), such as German or Finnish, have no separate words for sex and gender.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: There is no separate word for "gender" in German. [Geschlecht](https://dict.leo.org/forum/viewWrongentry.php?idforum=3&idThread=1034998&lp=ende&lang=en) in German means both sex as well as gender \( Reflections on Feminist Family Therapy Training, [p.69](https://web.archive.org/web/20180508090147/https://books.google.com/books?id=JHlsBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA69#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.1.3. Con: If they were the same, transgenders would not exist. [Transgender people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_gender_distinction#Transgender_and_genderqueer) experience a mismatch between their gender identity and their assigned sex.
1.1.4. Pro: Gender and sex refer to the same concept, the idea that society divides into groupings \(traditionally male and female\). The difference between them is not between the concepts of sex versus gender, but in their application.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Sex is considered the medical or [scientific term](https://www.scienceabc.com/eyeopeners/what-is-the-difference-between-sex-and-gender.html) relating to biology's understanding of these sex/gender groupings.
1.1.4.2. Pro: [Gender](https://www.scienceabc.com/eyeopeners/what-is-the-difference-between-sex-and-gender.html) explores these same groupings \(traditionally a male and female dichotomy\) but in arts, humanities and social science fields, including our understanding of sex/ gender as a concept relating to other important aspects of our lives including our perception, identity, expression, society and culture.
1.1.4.3. Pro: There are simply two words, or terms used for this concept, depending on which field it is being used in.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: Other concepts such as race are similarly distinct in their expression within, and beyond, science. In science, [race](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3167748/) is a category which impacts one's health predispositions and medical needs, while in the humanities, [race](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/racial-identity) is a lived experience with strong historical and cultural ties and importance in identity formation and expression. This does not mean there are two distinct concepts.
1.2. Pro: Gender and sex should be considered as the same thing.
1.2.1. Con: For those who are nonbinary or trans*, gender and sex are obviously different.
1.2.1.1. Con: For both concepts, a trans, genderqueer or non-binary person faces a battle in getting recognition from society of the limitations of the concept and how their lived experience falls outside that norm. These criticisms are not exclusively applied to gender.
1.2.1.2. Pro: A lot of effort and resources in gaining acceptance for trans and non-binary people has revolved around increasing people's understandings of [how sex and gender differ](https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2014/feb/07/mind-your-language-transgender) and how this leaves a gap in the middle where a person can be assigned male at birth but have a gender identity that does not fit with this assigned sex.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Making sex and gender the same concept could erode this important work and further endanger the safety and lives of trans and non-binary people.
1.2.1.3. Pro: If a sex is assigned to a person at birth but they later realize that this sex does not fit with their gender identity and expression, it is clear that they are two distinct concepts. For a cisgender person their sex happens to align with their gender, but this is not the case for everyone.
1.2.2. Pro: It would be easier to point out the flaws in the current understandings of both sex and gender if the fights against outdated understanding of sex and gender were united.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Currently, intersex activists and feminist science try to increase our awareness and understanding of the limitations of our understanding sex: how the [dichotomy](https://www.fastcompany.com/90139392/this-graphic-maps-the-whole-spectrum-of-sex-and-its-way-more-complicated-than-you-think) may not be the most accurate understanding of how genes and sex traits actually occur across the human population.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: At the same time, the LGBTQIA+ movement is fighting to increase our understanding of how sex, sexuality and gender differ. This creates competing voices instead of a united call for us to rethink how we understand the concept of sex/ gender which could include all of the issues these groups currently campaign on.
1.2.2.2. Con: If these concepts were blurred together, the biggest group \(either in terms of numbers or 'political capital'\) would get the most attention and publicity while important but smaller groups would lose their voice in changing our understanding of these important concepts and how they are failing certain groups in society.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: If some of these groups are so small/ vulnerable to losing their voice if both fights were united, then they are unlikely to have a lot of visibility and power under either system. They may achieve more from being part of a bigger campaign for change than they can achieve on their own.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Sex is usually considered to be a dichotomy between male and female, yet [sources suggest](https://www.healthline.com/health/sex-vs-gender#sex) that 1% of the population is intersex \(or have a DSD, a medical term for intersex conditions\).
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Some scientists consider this percentage of people with DSD to [suggest](https://www.healthline.com/health/sex-vs-gender#sex) that there are flaws with the sex dichotomy because it cannot account for significant numbers in the population.
1.2.2.3.2. Pro: Each of the key markers used in determining sex are [unable](https://www.healthline.com/health/sex-vs-gender#sex) to account for groups such as those with DSD and trans people. This weakens the dichotomy as an accurate scientific concept.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Gender has also been traditionally divided into male and female with little to no room for existing between the dichotomy \(gender non-binary\), rejecting the dichotomy \(gender queer\), or crossing the dichotomy \(trans\) despite the [long history across cultures](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/11/181624/gender-fluid-examples-history) of these groups existing.
1.2.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.2.2.5. Con: There has been a lot of movement in people's [understandings of gender](https://www.healthline.com/health/sex-vs-gender#gender). Many people [recognise](https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/Pathways_SOTU_2018_gender-ID.pdf) that gender is not a simple dichotomy between male and female. However, most people still think of sex as a category made up of [only male and female](https://slate.com/technology/2018/11/sex-binary-gender-neither-exist.html). This would make it very difficult to try unite the concepts.
1.2.3. Pro: It is too confusing for people to try grapple with an intricate distinction between notions of gender and sex.
1.2.3.1. Con: Making important concepts easier to understand should be less important than ensuring these concepts are accurate and workable.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Sex is a very widely used concept in medical and legal settings. This makes it particularly important that it is 'fit for purpose' within these settings.
1.2.3.2. Con: For the average cisgender person, they may never need \(or want\) to engage with the concepts of sex and gender. Their ease of understanding has very little impact in their daily lives.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: By comparison, a trans or non-binary person still faces many obstacles relating to their gender identity in their daily lives \(recognition, medical needs, discrimination etc.\). Concepts of sex and gender that include their lived experience are important to reduce these obstacles.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: If a simplified version of 'sex and gender' replaced current understandings of sex and of gender, this could threaten trans and non-binary people's ability to access legal recognition, medical care to transition and protection from discrimination and hate crime.
1.2.4. Con: If there are differences between sex and gender then it is wrong to try and force them to both fit together as one concept.
1.2.4.1. Pro: This would make it much more likely that some elements of sex or gender would be mistakenly included/ excluded in the 'gender and sex' combined concept. There is value in allowing both concepts to develop independently based on science \(hard sciences and social science\).
1.3. Con: Gender and sex and completely different concepts.
1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.3.2. Con: While sex and gender are [distinct concepts](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/232363.php) coming from biology and sociology respectively, the concept of gender is tied to sex which means they cannot be seen as completely independent.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Some feminist theorists [argue](https://familyinequality.wordpress.com/2013/09/14/why-i-dont-defend-the-sex-versus-gender-distinction/) that upholding a sex/ gender distinction is impeding our progress as it prevents us from seeing that while culture is sociocultural, biology \(and how we understand sex\) is a field that is formed on the basis of our social understandings and is not the 'objective science' we may imagine.
1.3.3. Pro: [Not everyone's](https://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender) gender identity, expression or behavior conforms to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth.
1.3.3.1. Pro: According to the Williams Institute, [in 2016](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/how-many-adults-identify-as-transgender-in-the-united-states/), approximately 0.6 percent of adults in the United States identified as transgender. This translates to just over 1.3 million adults.
1.4. Con: While gender and sex are closely related, they are not the same thing. They are closely related yet different.
1.4.1. Pro: Sex is based on science \(e.g. our genes and sex organs \)while gender is supposed to be a social/ cultural construct on how sex is 'performed'/ realized in society. This makes them closely related to one another but nonetheless separate concepts.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Gender is recognised as a [concept that varies](https://www.scienceabc.com/eyeopeners/what-is-the-difference-between-sex-and-gender.html)depending on the history and culture of the society in which one lives. The ways in which genders are expressed has changed over time and from place to place, suggesting that our culture and norms shape the way in which gender is expressed.
