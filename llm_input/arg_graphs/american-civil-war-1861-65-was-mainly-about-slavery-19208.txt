Discussion Title: American Civil War (1861-65) was mainly about slavery

1. American Civil War \(1861-65\) was mainly about slavery
1.1. Con: The American Civil War was about the North opposing Southern secession, because it wanted to preserve a large and powerful state.
1.1.1. Pro: If the war was primarily motivated by a desire to stop slavery then the Union should have declared war on [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Brazil) as well, which imported many more slaves than North America, and which only abolished slavery in 1888.
1.1.1.1. Con: The parent claim is essentially whataboutism.
1.2. Pro: The seceding states explicitly identified with slavery and justified their secession with it.
1.2.1. Pro: Mississippi in its [secession declaration](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_missec.asp) named its thorough identification "with the institution of slavery" as the foremost reason for secession.
1.2.2. Pro: Texas in its [secession declaration](https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/secession/2feb1861.html) named "the abolition of negro slavery throughout the confederacy" as one of the demands by the other states that lie at the bottom of the dispute that led to secession.
1.2.3. Con: Not quite sure what you mean with "explicitly identified" \@ \@superkartoffel as slavery was legal in all states at that time except for the ones who had previously passed manumission laws. When the War finally ended, there were still 6 non-CSA states that allowed slavery: Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey & West Virginia.
1.2.4. Con: They would also include rights and self determination as other explicitly identified reasons within the same breath.
1.3. Pro: Attacks against the institution of slavery drove the Southern States to secede.
1.3.1. Pro: Attacks against slavery "were" a primary grievance contained in the [Declaration of Causes of Seceding States](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states).
1.3.2. Con: Many would assert that talk of secession \(in the South-see Hartford Convention\) didn't start until tariffs implemented in earlier 1800's heavily benefitted factory owners over the agrarian southern states & were contrary to their interests. There were virtually no factories in the entire South. Freight rates were higher for bulk raw materials over the same mass of finished goods.
1.4. Pro: Every seceding State allowed slavery
1.4.1. Con: Lincoln rescinded an Emancipation Proclamation in MO by John C. Fremont during 1861 & two in '62 by General David Hunter on the SC/GA/FL coasts
1.4.1.1. Pro: The proclamation by Lincoln when revoking Hunter's emancipation order clearly states why slavery would be abolished, to maintain the government. "...whether at any time, in any case, it shall have become a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the government..."
1.4.1.1.1. Con: Slavery WAS slowly being extinguished-legislatively-State by State w/o Federal intervention. Exactly the way most Founding Fathers envisioned with states' rights & balance of power. Also remember that the US by 1864 was less than 12 years from Charles Brush inventing the "open coil" generator producing a study current of electricity. As well as being little more than a decade away from modernization in agricultural mechanization with the development of Nikolaus Otto's internal combustion engine.
1.4.2. Con: Some States that didn't secede allowed slavery & continued to practice it after War's end.
1.4.3. Pro: Topic of Slavery had caused intense friction between those siding with either Abolitionists or Fire Eaters
1.4.4. Pro: Northern States wanted to stop the spread of slavery into new territories & limit Southern power in Congress
1.4.5. Pro: Lincoln had argued against the spread of slavery in debates with Stephen A. Douglas
1.4.6. Con: Discord existed between Southerners & Northerners since the late 18th century
1.5. Con: The South had the option of supporting the Corwin Amendment, which Lincoln supported, which would have protected slavery. They did not. That's because it wasn't just about slavery. It was a cultural division which included views on slavery.
1.5.1. Pro: Interesting that Thomas Corwin of Ohio \(Copperheads\) introduced in it the House while New York's \(considered secession\) William Seward presented to Senate. Also recall 2 non-border Union states still had slavery: Delaware & New Jersey. Text~No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere, within any State, with the domestic institutions thereof, including that of persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State.
1.6. Con: At least four Union states had slavery: Maryland, Missouri, Delaware, and Kentucky.
1.7. Con: President Lincoln revoked emancipation proclamations issued by generals during the war twice: General Hunter and General Fremont. Thus demonstrating, as stated in the revocation of Hunter's order, that the eventual emancipation of the slaves in the South was used as a political and military strategy, not as an end goal.
1.8. Con: The Key Issue was not just slavery but the Asset/Economic Rights of both States and of Men. There was a lot more Economic Reasons and issues against central authority with slavery regarded as more of an economic factor rather then a moral one.
1.8.1. Pro: The Civil War was mainly caused by disputes between the North and South regarding their differing economic values. Tensions were already accumulating as a result of the [Tariff of 1828](https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1800-1850/The-Tariff-of-Abominations/), which helped protect northern industries while inflating the prices of foreign goods in the South. Combined with calls for African American equality from the North, this threatened the slavery-based agrarian lifestyle in the South and caused states to secede.
1.9. Con: President Lincoln never emancipated any slaves in the Union states
1.10. Con: Manumission was not approved in the Union capital of Washington, DC until April 16, 1862
1.10.1. Con: Following the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, slavery was still allowed in the Union controlled areas of the Confederacy
