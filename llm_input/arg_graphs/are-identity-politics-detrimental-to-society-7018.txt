Discussion Title: Are identity politics detrimental to society?

1. Identity politics are detrimental to society.
1.1. Pro: Identity politics strip a person of any value or individuality beyond their prescribed social group.
1.1.1. Pro: Identity politics assumes that a person's values, beliefs and interests are based upon their race, gender and sexual orientation instead of the individual.
1.1.1.1. Pro: The term ["race traitor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_traitor) arose when those who prescribe to 'identity politics' were challenged by members of their own race.
1.1.1.2. Con: Experiences associated with membership of a culturally recognised identity group clearly do inform beliefs and voting behaviour. In 2008, for example, [95% of African-American voters supported Barack Obama.](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/how-groups-voted-2008)
1.1.1.3. Con: Identity is simply the result of individuals’ shared social and/or economic experiences, and histories that are often also reflected in shared beliefs, customs, and lifestyles.
1.1.1.4. Pro: Identity politics gets hopelessly complicated and impractical when groups are combined \([intersectionality](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/intersectionality)\). A black lesbian truck driver would inevitably have competing identity interests. And so on. The IDs stack up as quickly as oppressed groups are identified, and no-one has the choice not to join.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Which groups an individual identifies with, and by how much is entirely subjective.
1.1.1.4.2. Pro: Feelings of oppression from identity categories are subjective. By example: Two black lesbian truck drivers might have different experiences of what parts of their identity oppresses them and how.
1.1.1.4.3. Con: In the given example, the woman can identify both as black and lesbian, there is no conflict of identity interests simply because these groups pertain to different attributes of society.
1.1.1.5. Con: People are naturally self-interested. In many cases, it would be clearly self-defeating for a member of an identity group to reject policies working in favor of their respective identity group. Values, beliefs, and interests can thereby \(for the most part\) be inferred from someone insofar as a policy promotes the general welfare of their respective identity group.
1.1.1.5.1. Con: By designating one side of an issue as "clearly" self-defeating for a group, you assume that all members of the group feel the same about an issue. Many women feel that abortion is wrong, but you might dismiss their desire for more control over abortion because you've assumed you know what's best for them.
1.1.1.5.2. Con: Assuming or inferring what an entire group believes based on the color of their skin is the definition of prejudice – making an assumption about a large, diverse group based on their racial, gender, or sexual identity.
1.1.1.6. Con: Identity politics only unites people towards a particular issue, and thus, in no way affects every other belief and decision they have/make.
1.1.2. Con: Identifying as a group does not strip a person of value or individuality. Plenty of people are proud to be American, military, government officials, women, men, or a variety of different groups without stripping themselves of all value and individuality.
1.1.2.1. Con: Identity politics is associated with ethnicity, gender, or sexuality which are a fixed reality.
1.1.3. Con: Identity politics is oriented towards the perfection of individualism, because it seeks to remove the barriers to individual liberties. For example, anti-racism argues that one shouldn't be beholden to assumptions and stereotypes of one's race.
1.1.3.1. Con: Identity politics is the antonym of individualism. You don't need to belong to any group to conceive that racism is a bad thing. Identity politics has created "reverse-racism" whereby you assume an individual outside your group is inherently racist towards you because of the identity group that you ascribe them in. Attributing someone's individual characteristics/actions to a group is dangerous, as is group think. In both cases, you are eliminating the need for rationality and critical thinking.
1.1.3.2. Con: Identity politics does not eliminate stereotypes. It merely replaces old stereotypes with new ones. For instance, liberal identity politics stereotypes all white men as privileged oppressors without taking into account the individual circumstances of the men in question, which may in fact be far from privileged.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Another example of this is “[Not All Men](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NotAllMen).” It used to be a phrase used to push back on negative stereotypes of all men. Now, proponents of identity politics use the phrase to mock persons who attempt to push back against sweeping stereotypes of an entire gender.
1.1.4. Pro: Identity politics has in the past given rise to the deaths of millions under authoritarian dictatorships where group identity is made paramount over individuality, eg. under [Stalin](http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/genocide/stalin.htm), [Mao](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html), etc.
1.1.5. Pro: Identity politics results in members following along with the tenants of their political identity rather than thinking through each issue for themselves.
1.2. Con: Humans advocating for their own liberation and equality in a society dominated by a certain group is not detrimental to society, but rather advances society.
1.2.1. Con: It is preferable to advocate for liberation and equality for all. If one advocates human rights it already encompasses women's rights, gay rights and black rights without identity politics.
1.2.1.1. Con: Unless expressly outlined, one person's idea of liberation and equality may not include the same rights for another identity group.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: If different groups give different meanings to liberty then we can never make policies that will not infringe on another group's idea of liberty.
1.2.1.2. Con: This assumes all groups experience inequality the same way. In order to ensure “equality for all” society needs to understand how different groups experience inequality and address those issues specifically.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Different injustices have different causes and different solutions. For them to be effectively addressed you will need to have separate campaigns for reform. That one is particularly active for one's own liberation does not exclude them from advocating human rights in general.
1.2.2. Pro: Society is already run by the "identity politics" of the privileged. Modern leftist identity politics only evens the playing field by allowing other groups \(the oppressed\) to assess their own needs and interests.
1.2.2.1. Con: Instead of the left proposing their own brand of identity politics we should work on dismantling the identity politics of the right. Identity politics, regardless of which side of the political aisle its from, is detrimental to the concept of individual freedom.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: To ask oppressed minority groups to stand down and wait until "society" takes care of the problem is to leave things in the hands of those that are already in a position to oppress. Oppressors are unlikely to self-remediate their advantage without being pressured by those who, rightly, practice self-defense in the form of so-called identity politics.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: The previous argument did not suggest asking oppressed minority groups to stand down. It suggested that every individual stand up in opposition to the identity politics of the political right.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Identity politics leads to prejudiced attention towards advancing the interests of one's identity group at the expense of others.
1.2.3. Con: Identity politics is not humans advocating for their own liberation. Identity politics is specifically about a certain identity group becoming the main stage of political action/advocacy, and viewing the world through the lens of "certain groups". That is not a coherent or useful way to perceive the political arena.
1.2.3.1. Con: If a group of people are actually, as a group, harmed or hindered by current political/power operations in a society, there is no good way to address that problem without making that identity take the "main stage."
1.2.3.1.1. Con: This isn’t true. As a counter example, black people are disproportionately represented in the ranks of the poor. One good way to ameliorate this injustice is to work to improve conditions for all people in poverty irrespective of race. This will disproportionately benefit black people without being race conscious.
1.2.3.2. Con: The concept of identity is unavoidably connected with all forms of politics and any political action by its nature is an expression of one's values and identity.
1.2.4. Pro: If you replace "Identity politics is detrimental" with "Jewish people are detrimental" and return to the 1930s, you have the rise of fascism in Europe. People advocating for their own human rights should not be equated with being detrimental to society and therefore should not be squashed or silenced or worse.
1.2.4.1. Con: This is a false equivalence, as Jewish people are a group of people - whereas identity politics is not. What was identity politics under the Nazi regime was the "Aryan" identity, as well as enforced loyalty to the Nazi government.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: While not a term of art at the time, the "Aryan race" and "German national" were absolutely identity groups which upon forming a coalition advanced their perceived interests at the expense of everyone else.
1.2.4.2. Con: There is a massive difference between modern identity politics and groups advocating for themselves, or even civil rights.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Civil rights movements have often appealed to the principle that the proper way to treat someone is as a sovereign individual. The reason why blacks, or gay people, or trans people deserve respect is because they are human, not because of their particular identity.
1.2.5. Con: Society is only advanced when we take actions for the sake of everyone, not when a certain group advocates for themselves to further themselves and no one else.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Groups advocating only for their own rights leaves may worsen equality. Those from dominant groups \(i.e. the majority\) likely have the strongest voice and may be encouraged to further oppress others.
1.2.5.2. Con: In the US, the [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964) furthered the advancement of society by providing protections to those discriminated based on race. This almost entirely advanced the interests of people of color but was still a step forward for society.
1.2.6. Con: Identity politics is the same ideology which excused slavery in the first place, by promoting specific groups over others; that same ideology is pervasively detrimental to our society today, despite its less extreme form.
1.3. Con: Identity politics provide the partisanship needed to motivate social changes for equality.
1.3.1. Con: To promote partisanship is to promote division. Division is not necessary for social equality. In fact, division is counterproductive to the cause of social equality.
1.3.1.1. Con: The division already exists. The identity groups form because of this division, they don't cause it.
1.3.2. Pro: The inclusion of identity politics in societal conversation allows for groups that are disadvantaged to know who supports them and is willing to treat their issues as important.
1.3.3. Con: Identity politics creates internecine conflict between people who largely agree on values. They tend to push people into tribal camps such that building alliances is more difficult. Thus they tend to set back, rather than advance, their goals.
1.3.3.1. Pro: An example of this was when [BLM protestors deplatformed Bernie Sanders](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/black-lives-matter-protesters-shut-down-bernie-sanders-rally/). Virtually the entire audience was liberal and sympathetic to calls for racial justice. They were also concerned about the economic injustices Bernie was trying to speak against before he was forced to give the mic to the protesters. The protest needlessly divided groups of otherwise allied people into camps about what type of injustice was worse: economic or racial.
1.3.4. Pro: Identity politics allows for changes to issues and problems experienced by a specific group alone, which otherwise would have no political weight.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Identity politics focus public discussion and policy on historically marginalized groups whose concerns might not otherwise be present in mainstream political parties.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: This may increase political participation by those marginalised groups, making society more diverse and rich.
1.3.4.1.2. Con: Identity politics often leads to discussions not lead by empirical evidence but by anecdotal evidence.
1.3.4.1.2.1. Con: Identity politics can include empirical evidence, such as statistics that show a particular group is disadvantaged in specific ways.
1.3.4.1.2.2. Pro: The use of identity politics presupposes that a group faces certain issues, and this presupposition can often be traced back to personal experience\(s\). An example of which would be the [Combahee River Collective](http://circuitous.org/scraps/combahee.html) who split off from the National Black Feminist Organization.
1.3.4.2. Con: Problems and issues need to transcend that of a group. Racism, for example, is something that anyone can suffer. Society needs to eradicate racism but it can do this without identity politics.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: This may be true of racism on an individual basis, but is not helpful when thinking about the impact of systemic racism over many generations.
1.3.4.2.1.1. Con: The way that we can deal with the long term racism is in no way different from 'normal' racism.
1.3.4.3. Con: Identity politics is the product of a zero-sum fallacy, [namely](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/07/24/prejudice-and-the-perils-of-zero-sum-thinking/?noredirect=on) “that one racial or ethnic \[or other identity\] group can only get ahead at the expense of another.”
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: Identity "politics" is necessarily a zero-sum approach. The politics portion means that a group is trying to score through their identity over other identities.
1.3.4.3.1.1. Con: This does not have to be the case. Women advocating for the right to vote, for example, is about giving them equal rights to men, not aiming to put themselves ahead of men.
1.3.4.3.2. Con: This is not always true. For instance, the issues of gay marriage, and violent or even homicidal racial profiling by American police are unique to certain groups, and their resolution has been motivated by identity politics. They do not suffer from the zero-sum fallacy.
1.3.4.3.3. Con: Proponents of identity politics do not necessarily believe that the only way to improve societal conditions for one group is at the expense of another group.
1.4. Pro: Identity politics are primarily a manifestation of [Critical Theory](http://people.ucalgary.ca/~rseiler/critical.htm), a worldview which creates an asymmetrical view of moral duties and is ultimately [self-defeating](https://shenviapologetics.wordpress.com/a-long-review-of-race-class-and-gender-part-3/).
1.4.1. Pro: An inherently asymmetric view of human relationships leads to an asymmetric view of moral duties. These duties are immoral and justify the very discrimination that critical theorists claim to want to eradicate.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Provided that someone is identified with an ‘oppressor’ group, silencing them because of that identity marker can be morally permissible as a consequence of our fundamental moral duty to resist oppression. But silencing someone because of their identity is immoral. Therefore, critical theory results in moral duties that go against our moral intuitions.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Most people would recognize that silencing someone because of their gender is a blatant form of sexism. However, critical theory entails that it can be acceptable to silence someone because of gender if his gender is male.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Because of historical and present-day power dynamics, all males are part of an ‘oppressor’ group. When a man speaks, his position of power is potentially a form of oppression, particularly if he says something that a woman experiences as oppression. In that case, the woman is justified in silencing him, even if the same statements in the mouth of a woman would have not been experienced as oppressive.
1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: The same reasoning applies to silencing someone because of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc.
1.4.1.2. Pro: On the basis of critical theory, we would have to conclude that children are an oppressed class, suffering under the oppression of adults.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: There is a power differential between parents and children. Children are socially and even physically compelled to obey their parents’ commands. Therefore, under critical theory we are morally obligated to work for the liberation of children from their parents. This is absurd.
1.4.1.3. Pro: On the basis of critical theory, we would have to conclude that the mentally ill and criminals are an oppressed class, suffering under the oppression of institutions.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Mentally ill adults and criminals are often held, against their will, in institutions. There is a long history of horrific abuses \(lobotomies, sterilization\) within the mental health and criminal justice systems. Many crimes and mental illnesses are social constructs that differ between cultures. Therefore, under critical theory we are morally obligated to deconstruct notions of mental illness and criminality. This is absurd.
1.4.1.3.1.1. Con: It does not seem to be absurd that we should be obliged to revise notions of mental illness and criminality that have harmed the respective groups through connected stigma and/or disenfranchisement.
1.4.1.4. Con: Symmetry is not an inherent moral good.
1.4.2. Pro: Critical theory is self-refuting because it turns a blind eye to the power dynamics that critical theory \(itself\) creates and perpetuates.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Power is context-dependent. A trait that may give you power in one setting can be the basis for your oppression in another setting.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: In the United States, Christians plausibly enjoy “Christian privilege.” Drop them in Saudi Arabia, and that privilege turns into a liability.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Intellectualism may be rewarded in certain academic settings, but punished in certain social settings.
1.4.2.2. Pro: If a white person or a male or a conservative or an evangelical Christian or a heterosexual finds himself marginalized and excluded by those who embrace critical theory, then ‘critical theory’ become a means of oppression. Thus, critical theory defeats itself. It wields its principles selectively.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: For the most part, Critical advocates don't marginalize based on inherent, unchanging properties \(race, sex, religion, etc.\) but because of behaviors or practices which are dangerous, dehumanizing, or otherwise bad. It is accordingly improper to speak of a heterosexual or white person being marginalized by Critique. The bigot is marginalized by Critique, not other identities.
1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: To the extent that critical advocates don't marginalize based on inherent, unchanging properties \(race, sex, religion, etc.\), they are not practicing critical theory.
1.4.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Critical theory is built on [implicit assumptions](https://shenviapologetics.wordpress.com/a-long-review-of-race-class-and-gender-part-3/) that formulate it into a comprehensive, interpretive framework for understanding reality \(a worldview or religion\).
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Critical theory assumes all oppressed groups find their fundamental unity in their common experience of oppression.
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: “what Fanon taught me was the liberating power of anger… \[as an Asian-American\][I chose to ally myself](https://shenviapologetics.wordpress.com/a-long-review-of-race-class-and-gender-part-3/) with people of color, anti-colonialist movements, and a non-Eurocentric consciousness.” [Mura](http://www.davidmura.com/)
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: "I, as a Japanese-American, [feel a kinship](https://shenviapologetics.wordpress.com/a-long-review-of-race-class-and-gender-part-3/) to both Blacks and Native Americans that I do not feel with white Americans. It… comes from our histories as victims of injustice” [Mura](http://www.davidmura.com/)
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: “I realized I could be beaten on the street for being a \[lesbian\]. If my sister’s being beaten because she’s Black,[it’s pretty much the same principle](https://books.google.com/books?id=S_QudWQHaZ4C&pg=PA250&lpg=PA250&dq=%22If+my+sister%E2%80%99s+being+beaten+because+she%E2%80%99s+Black,+it%E2%80%99s+pretty+much+the+same+principle.%22&source=bl&ots=nFz3d5x2uU&sig=r_k4YFM1Nc8I2QygSOwYN1_3nzY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjzhsHhmsXeAhVNnlkKHTL_AAQQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22If%20my%20sister%E2%80%99s%20being%20beaten%20because%20she%E2%80%99s%20Black%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20pretty%20much%20the%20same%20principle.%22&f=false)...The connection is blatant… “[Moraga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherr%C3%ADe_Moraga)
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Critical theory presumes that our identity as individuals is inseparable from our group identity, especially our categorization as ‘oppressor’ or ‘oppressed’ with respect to a particular identity marker.
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: “Like racism, [sexism is a system of beliefs and behaviors by which a group is oppressed](https://books.google.com/books?id=R8-HitN5Jp0C&pg=PA179&lpg=PA179&dq=andersen+%22Like+racism,+sexism+is+a+system+of+beliefs+and+behaviors+by+which+a+group+is+oppressed,+controlled,+and+exploited+because+of+presumed+gender+differences%22&source=bl&ots=0LAXjdJZYC&sig=9p8p7oKMwaTClhnhCndtb8QEFQQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjIhauJlsXeAhVpuVkKHbyIAEIQ6AEwAHoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&q=andersen%20%22Like%20racism%2C%20sexism%20is%20a%20system%20of%20beliefs%20and%20behaviors%20by%20which%20a%20group%20is%20oppressed%2C%20controlled%2C%20and%20exploited%20because%20of%20presumed%20gender%20differences%22&f=false), controlled, and exploited because of presumed gender differences…. Homophobia – the fear of homosexuality- is part of the system of social control that legitimates and enforces gender oppression. It supports the system of compulsory heterosexuality” [Andersen](http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/faculty/kevin-anderson)
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: “[My schooling gave me no training in seeing myself as an oppressor](https://www.coursehero.com/file/p2pof0d/My-schooling-gave-me-no-training-in-seeing-myself-as-an-oppressor-as-an/)… I was taught \[wrongly\] to see myself as an individual whose moral state depended on her individual moral will” [McIntosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_McIntosh)
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Critical theory assumes that the fundamental human project is liberation from all forms of oppression; consequently, the fundamental virtue is standing in solidarity against the oppressor.
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: “[We need to overcome divisions among working people, not by ignoring the multiple oppressions many of us encounter,](https://books.google.com/books?id=j9fT_rBLQagC&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=%22We+need+to+overcome+divisions+among+working+people,+not+by+ignoring+the+multiple+oppressions+many+of+us+encounter,%22&source=bl&ots=6Rn8CsT2P8&sig=XhjH1RrzZ0nxi4IHrZ3z-_jjM6w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiTqKy6m8XeAhXBrFkKHYr-B24Q6AEwAHoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22We%20need%20to%20overcome%20divisions%20among%20working%20people%2C%20not%20by%20ignoring%20the%20multiple%20oppressions%20many%20of%20us%20encounter%2C%22&f=false)or by oppressing each other, but by becoming committed allies on all issues which affect working people: racism, sexism, classism, etc. An injury to one is an injury to all.” Langston
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: “Racism…, Sexism,…Ageism. Heterosexism. Elitism. Classism. [It is a lifetime pursuit](https://books.google.com/books?id=Kc47AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA285&lpg=PA285&dq=%22Classism.+It+is+a+lifetime+pursuit+for+each+one+of+us+to+extract+these+distortions+from+our+living%22&source=bl&ots=uhQbiTiPkh&sig=uGXHsJj7c7Z_E6i2r-ms-Lef7wE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjKkdigncXeAhVRtlkKHW-lAZUQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Classism.%20It%20is%20a%20lifetime%20pursuit%20for%20each%20one%20of%20us%20to%20extract%20these%20distortions%20from%20our%20living%22&f=false) for each one of us to extract these distortions from our living” [Lorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audre_Lorde)
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: Critical theory is premised on the idea that human relationships should be fundamentally understood in terms of power dynamics, which differentiates groups into ‘oppressors’ and ‘the oppressed’.
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Identity politics promotes self victimisation \(oppression\) and enforces a learned helplessness. There are only two categories for such groups - oppressor and oppressed. This enforces victimhood as to not be the victim the only other option is to be the perpetrator of oppression.
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Victimization is of no benefit to any sort of human character. It leads to self-pity and/or selfish endeavors to inherit rights that are either imposing on the rights of others, or are of no use to an individual.
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: What does build character is overcoming your adversities, not relying on your victim status.
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.4.1.2. Con: Identity politics leads to group political actions, such as the [Birmingham march of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf) and [Woman's sufferage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_suffrage), which disprove the argument that identity politics promotes self-victimization. Plenty of examples in history show identity politics leading to learned effectiveness and a better society. History disproves the argument that there are only two categories, "oppressor and oppressed".
1.4.2.2.1.1.1.4.2. Pro: “[Power is typically equated with domination and control over people or things.](https://shenviapologetics.wordpress.com/a-long-review-of-race-class-and-gender-part-3/) Social institutions depend on this version of power to reproduce hierarchies of race, class, and gender.” [Andersen](http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/faculty/kevin-anderson)
1.4.3. Con: Critical theory is a tool used to deconstruct and critique social and political issues including the white identity politics The United States was founded upon. It is a response to identity politics not the progenitor.
1.4.3.1. Con: Critical theory is a response to social injustice, not identity politics.
1.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.1.1.1.
1.4.5. Con: Understanding critical theory as an all-encompassing worldview \(or metanarrative\) is inconsistent with many applications of the approach; this claim equivocates on definitions of critical theory, attempting to defeat them all by criticizing the approach of only a narrow subset.
1.5. Con: Identity politic advocates have provided clear paths forward that will produce real results and improvements for those they represent, that do not violate the rights of other groups.
1.5.1. Pro: Effective identity politics provide an extremely heuristic approach to combating [systemic oppression](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01419870.2012.669839).
1.5.1.1. Con: It's an extremely poor, low-resolution heuristic, that tries to identify what affects the entirety of any large, otherwise diverse group, like all people of a certain race, creed, or color.
1.5.1.2. Con: A "heuristic" by definition is a shortcut. Another "heuristic" might be called [stereotyping](https://www.verywellmind.com/representativeness-heuristic-2795805). Fighting racism by using stereotyping is like fighting fire with more fire.
1.5.2. Con: It is not true that identity politics provides clear paths forward. The Canadian [Bill C-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Act_to_amend_the_Canadian_Human_Rights_Act_and_the_Criminal_Code) for instance makes it illegal to incite or promote hatred because of gender identity or gender expression. What constitutes hate is so poorly defined however, that this very discussion could be considered promoting hate.
1.5.2.1. Con: Canada's legal system is based on common law, meaning that ambiguous terms in a given piece of legislation are defined in terms of accumulated precedent. Because of this, bill C-16 inherits the accumulated understanding of what constitutes inciting and promoting hatred from all other decisions in Canadian legal history.
1.5.3. Con: The results of identity politics often end up violating the rights of other groups. We have to weigh protecting of rights against the taking of rights and not characterize identity politics as only protecting rights.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Bill are laws that are supposed to protect the rights of a certain identity can also take away rights from others. If a law says that gays can't be made fun off, the freedom of speech of others has been infringed as they now can't make jokes about gay people.
1.5.3.2. Con: Society is not a zero-sum game. One can advocate for the end to certain abuses or discriminatory practices without reducing the freedoms of the rest of society. Identity politics, when applied constructively, can be used to build one group up rather than tear everyone else down.
1.5.3.3. Pro: The quotas used in affirmative action artificially create diversity in favor of specific groups at the equal expense of every other group.
1.6. Pro: Identity politics inhibit popular cooperation on those issues which concern society most.
1.6.1. Pro: Identity politics prioritize personal experience over factual evidence. This tends to be less convincing to general society.
1.6.1.1. Con: The assertion assumes a clear and evident difference between "factual evidence" and "personal experience". But hundreds of years of empirical and theoretical work have fully undermined this sort of positivistic dichotomy. When it comes to human conscience, all "factual evidence" is somehow entangled with subjective perception; similarly, all "personal experience" is in itself factual.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: The parent claim is a postmodern doctrine that entails that these are both social constructs, and factual evidence cannot be described as such. Facts are objective, and do not change based on a person's perspective, where a personal experience is based purely on ones perception. Whether or not factual evidence is entangled by one's bias, it is still objective. The person's perception of these facts may be subjective, but not the facts themselves.
1.6.1.2. Con: Identity politics uses both personal experience and factual evidence to change hearts and minds.
1.6.1.2.1. Pro: [The Other Wes Moore by Wes Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore#The_Other_Wes_Moore) uses personal experience to change hearts and minds.
1.6.1.2.2. Pro: [The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander](http://newjimcrow.com/) uses factual evidence to change minds on African American incarceration rates..
1.6.1.2.3. Con: Factual evidence is only used in identity politics if it fits a narrative.
1.6.1.2.3.1. Con: Politics of any kind rarely present a balanced view. For identity politics in particular, it would be unusual for any group that feels marginalized and is campaigning for extending their rights to present arguments that attempt to refute or deny their subordinate status.
1.6.1.2.4. Con: That's not necessarily a good thing if the direction is bad.
1.6.1.3. Pro: It makes the "Appeal to authority" logical fallacy. Simply because one group has an experience, doesn't mean they get precedence or authority in a conversation, especially when it mutes or dismisses others' opinions
1.6.1.3.1. Con: "Appeal to Authority" is not a logical fallacy, but "appeal to illegitimate authority" is. A group's experience gives them authority to speak on the topic in which they have experience. This ought to be held in greater regard than those who have no experience in the topic.
1.6.1.3.1.1. Con: Appeal to Authority is a logical fallacy in which an authority's support of an argument is used as evidence for the conclusion. Minority groups can be authorities on issues that affect them, but their support for a conclusion does not in and of itself mean that that conclusion is sound.
1.6.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: For an argument to be sound, the opinions of the group appealing to be an authority first need to be valid, that is, the claims are coherent and reasonably deducible. After this, they must be inline with reality in order to be sound; the opinions must align with the factual nature of the world around them.
1.6.1.3.1.2. Con: Almost everyone \(even those considered privileged\) has experienced injustice of some kind. One person does not need to have the exact experience as another to be able to understand and opine on a topic.
1.6.1.4. Con: Identity is inherently personal.
1.6.1.4.1. Con: Identity has largely been ascribed by society.
1.6.1.5. Con: Fact is always subjective and has constantly changed over time. Therefore, its relation to personal experience is and always has been inextricable.
1.6.1.5.1. Con: Facts are by [definition](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fact) not subjective.
1.6.1.5.2. Con: Our knowledge has mostly evolved over time because of better standards for studies and improved technology. That has little to do with opinions.
1.6.1.6. Con: Personal experience is factual evidence, particularly in the aggregate. Rarely do claims that are made in the interest of a given identity reach the level of public discourse without being vetted and affirmed by other members of the group.
1.6.1.6.1. Con: Natural \(hard\) sciences are more reliable than personal experiences. Hard sciences do better at things like: hard testable predictions, controlling experiments, accuracy and objectivity, more consensus, cumulativeness, replicability. It generally applies a purer form of the scientific method.
1.6.1.7. Pro: Identity politics prioritize the subjective experiences of group members over the collective interests of everyone by highlighting rare cases to support their agendas. This is why cases of white cops shooting black men are disproportionately covered on liberal media outlets, and cases of illegal immigrants committing atrocious crimes are disproportionately covered on conservative outlets.
1.6.2. Pro: Identity politics alienate people from each other and lessen the potential to find common ground on issues.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Identity politics use the group to define the individual in that a person's group is used to assume the realities of a person's life. If a person is white, he is privileged, if a person is black, he is disadvantaged. The reality is that group identity is an indicator for how individuals are treated, but this approach is much less useful when you have the ability to view the realities of a situation for an individual.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: Identity politics does not assume the circumstances of individuals, but brings attention to commonly shared problems within groups of people to which certain labels have been claimed or forced upon.
1.6.2.2. Pro: Identity politics serve a singular purpose; to divide the populace solely on the basis of "you don't look like me, therefore how could you think like me".
1.6.2.3. Con: There is nothing inherently alienating about admitting that different people in different groups might have different experiences and political goals. Overreacting, and claiming "Identity politics" as a way to shut down discussion lessens the ability to find common ground.
1.6.2.3.1. Con: Identity politics enforces tribalism and leads people to believe in the "dangerous other." Your politics becomes "who you are" instead of "what you believe". Subscribing to the belief that a particular group will almost always have a specific opinion removes nuance from discussion.
1.6.2.3.1.1. Con: Sometimes "who you are" influences "what you believe". If "who you are" is a trans woman and there are laws preventing specifically you from using public bathrooms, your identity is going to influence your politics.
1.6.2.3.2. Pro: Suggesting that coal miners in Kentucky have different experiences and different political goals than IT professionals in Boston doesn't automatically lessen the ability for both groups to find common ground.
1.6.2.4. Con: Identity politics doesn't alienate people but rather builds understanding between groups.
1.6.2.4.1. Con: The act of talking about ''marginalized groups'' and ''non-marginalized groups'' alone alienates people. It isolates people in groups they don't necessarily share anything with.
1.6.2.4.2. Pro: Identity politics can allow different groups to better understand each other by allowing marginalized groups to identify their needs and concerns.
1.6.2.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.6.2.5. Con: Many identitarian groups do themselves find common ground in their pursuing of rights and freedoms for their group \([intersectionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality)\). This shows that the division does not arise from the identity itself, but by the challenging of power that identity politics encourages.
1.6.2.6. Pro: Addressing under privilege and inequality is important but often created or magnified for political gain. Politicians create minorities as victims whilst simultaneously pretending to be the heroes who come to their aid.
1.6.2.6.1. Pro: To gain the moral high ground, the audience is enrolled in voting for the pretend hero who is fighting for the victim. The pretense often creates a false perpetrator who is then persecuted. This dynamic is described by the [Karpman drama triangle.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karpman_drama_triangle)
1.6.2.7. Con: There is no reason to seek 'common ground' on issues such as whether the LGBTQ+ community deserves equal rights and recognition. Sometimes what is needed is not common ground, but recognition that certain groups face marginalisation and attack, and thus should have a common movement to lobby for rights.
1.6.2.8. Pro: Identity politics tends to divide society in groups based on discriminatory, mostly innate characteristics leading to [tribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribalism) that history has proven time and again to promote intolerance and violence.
1.6.2.8.1. Con: The objective goals of identity politics are not to promote tribalism, but rather to promote equal and appropriate representation of all identities in a system historically and predominantly controlled by [only one identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony).
1.6.2.8.1.1. Con: “Equal” representation between demographic groups is not necessarily desirable when the demographic groups themselves constitute very unequal proportions of the population.
1.6.2.8.1.1.1. Con: This argument invokes tyranny of the majority. Access to opportunity and equal rights, justice, and representation should not be reliant on population.
1.6.2.8.1.1.1.1. Con: The claim this responds to does not suggest that all people should not be given equal access to justice and rights. It does say that it is not necessarily just to purposefully try to ensure that every population group has the same number of representatives in government as every other when certain demographics represent a far smaller proportion of the population than others.
1.6.3. Pro: Identity politics erode social solidarity.
1.6.3.1. Con: Identity politics promotes social solidarity by bringing the needs and cares of disadvantaged groups to the forefront of conversation, and treating them as a vital part of that society.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: Bringing the needs of marginalized groups to the forefront switches focus from more detrimental economic and geo-political issues to providing rights for these groups that would not be universally beneficial.
1.6.3.2. Con: Identity politics is in itself a form of social solidarity. Any kind of identity politics aims at uniting individuals from one single identity group.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: In its morally ideal sort, identity politics also challenges the exclusion of certain groups from the "social" and forces powerful groups to recognize the need to be supportive of them.
1.6.3.3. Con: Minorities exist because "social solidarity" has excluded them and because the powerful determine who is, and who is not, together with them. Asking that identity politics be left behind is nothing more than a request that members of a persecuted minority stand alone as the "social solidarity" tramples them.
1.6.3.4. Pro: Identity politics are inherently selfish.
1.6.3.4.1. Pro: Identity politics are too self-referential to establish the common ground required for progressive discourse.
1.6.3.4.2. Con: By helping people empathize with and understand the challenges of those who have had different opportunities, barriers, biases, and experiences, Identity Politics can help people become less selfish and more self-aware.
1.6.3.4.2.1. Con: Identity politics may be a contributing factor of galvanizing a particular group against another.
1.6.3.4.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.1.1.1.2.
1.6.3.4.2.2. Con: It is not apparent that identity politics results in increased empathy among groups.
1.6.3.4.3. Con: It's not selfish to band together to provide rights for fellow citizens.
1.6.3.4.3.1. Pro: [Rabbi Stephen S. Wise](https://www.fromthesquare.org/mere-men-helped-win-vote-women/#.W5CMtvZFxPY) selflessly fought for women's right to vote saying: “As long as women are shut out from citizenship and the exercise of the ballot, which is the symbol of citizenship, ours is no democracy,".
1.6.3.4.4. Con: Ignoring the needs/challenges of those who are not in your group is the true definition of inherent selfishness.
1.6.3.4.5. Con: There is nothing selfish about establishing a platform from which to express problems faced uniquely by those like you or others you empathize with.
1.6.3.4.5.1. Con: It is however, inherently selfish to promote protective rights for an individual or group that would not be universally beneficial.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1. Pro: Identity politics can go beyond respectful discourse and advocacy instead of choosing to resort to demonizing, berating, and, among hate groups like [Antifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifa_\(United_States\)), even calling for violence against those groups labelled as oppressors.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.1.1.1.3.
1.6.3.4.5.1.1.2. Pro: The [Rise and Resist](https://www.riseandresist.org/about/) movement, which was created to defeat oppressive policies of government against alleged violence, bigotry, and systemic discrimination, directly and openly encourages [civil disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience) and [street theater](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=street%20theater).
1.6.3.4.5.2. Pro: There is nothing selfish about confronting your blissfully unaware granddad about his being a racist.
1.6.3.4.6. Pro: Identity politics are the antithesis of "...ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.”
1.6.3.4.6.1. Con: If your country is ignoring the problems faced by yourself and others like you, it is to the detriment of that country if it doesn't work to address those problems. Therefore, \[good\] identity politics are country-serving.
1.6.3.5. Pro: Identity politics is the classic divide and conquer strategy. Under the guise of raising awareness and taking action to mitigate the sufferings of people with very specific attributes, the group identity is lost and the voting bloc is effectively Balkanized. Under this strategy, political power is focused only on furthering the goals of a small, specific group thus diluting the political power that could be directed, en masse, to common goals.
1.6.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.1.1.1.4.
1.6.3.5.2. Con: Identity is multi-faceted and involves intersectionality on various levels. For example, it is possible to be British, gay, Asian and disabled. One identity does not negate the other and so it is possible to find solidarity with others on many levels.
1.6.3.6. Pro: Without identity politics we would never think that just because our neighbor is a different skin tone or has a different sexual orientation, that would be a basis for us not liking them.
1.6.3.6.1. Pro: Identity politics highlights differences and therefore encourages us to see ourselves as separate from people different to us.
1.6.3.6.2. Con: It is not apparent from human history that people are drawn to others who aren't like them. [Individuals join groups with which they have commonalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belongingness#Social_connections), whether it is sense of humor, style in clothing, socioeconomic status, or career goals. In general, individuals seek out those who are most similar to them.
1.6.4. Pro: Identity politics are a distraction to more important issues.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Foreign adversaries are using identity politics issues to distract and interfere with social progress.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: If we don't want oppressed groups levered against us, the smartest move might be to stop oppressing them.
1.6.4.1.1.1. Pro: Identity politics would not be necessary if there was education provided to the public that provides transparent understanding about the position of those groups, giving individuals outside the group a platform for acceptance.
1.6.4.1.1.2. Con: Actual oppression is not necessary for the propaganda to work. All that is needed is a widespread perception of oppression, even a false perception.
1.6.4.1.2. Con: Foreign adversaries use any politics to distract and interfere against progress.
1.6.4.1.2.1. Pro: The behavior of such adversaries and our relationship to them is itself the problem; identity politics are merely exploited.
1.6.4.1.3. Pro: Russia, for instance, targets black Americans with messages designed to [perpetuate the false narrative](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-ira-target-black-americans/amp) that racial relations are far worse in America than they actually are.
1.6.4.2. Con: The unimportance of an issue cannot be unilaterally determined by unaffected individuals/groups.
1.6.4.2.1. Con: The importance and prioritization of issues that impact all humankind should be self evident. Issues brought about through identify politics, by default, never impact all humankind.
1.6.4.2.1.1. Con: Many of the important issues of the world \(the eradication of poverty, diseases etc.\) also do not affect all of humanity. It is very difficult to find an issue that truly does affect all of humanity simultaneously.
1.6.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Global warming and prevention of nuclear war are fairly clear counter examples of issues that effect everyone.
1.6.4.2.1.1.2. Con: Disease and poverty are issues that immediately affect few but ultimately affect everyone - due to things like migration. Few ills stay where they started.
1.6.4.3. Con: Plenty of important issues have been driven by discussions of identity. Women's Suffrage, Emancipation, and Religious Freedom are not a "distraction", but are the more important issues.
1.6.4.4. Con: Issues that negatively affect a group of people based on their identity are important issues to those people, and thus should be treated as such.
1.6.4.4.1. Con: Global issues that affect all groups should be addressed before issues that affect specific social groups.
1.6.4.4.1.1. Pro: Environmental issues are more important than identity politics-related issues.
1.6.4.4.1.2. Con: This would argue that the [civil rights marchers](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/selma-montgomery-march) should have put off their fights for equality because the [Vietnam war marchers](https://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war/vietnam-war-protests) were also protesting the war, and would have delayed civil rights by at least [10 years. \(From 1965 to 1975\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War). This would lead to delaying liberty, which is detrimental to society.
1.6.4.4.1.2.1. Con: It also argues that if the War issue required a vote for a particular candidate contrary to the preference for a civil rights candidate, then the voter would need to choose based on highest priority. These trade-offs define representative democratic politics. The discussion concerns identity politics, not identity advocacy. Marches and rallies and letters to the editor are all advocacy. But a voter gets just one vote, so must choose based on priority.
1.6.4.4.1.3. Con: It is possible to address global issues and social issues simultaneously.
1.6.4.4.1.3.1. Con: Sometimes it is impossible to deal with social issues before dealing with global issues.
1.6.4.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: American slavery is an example of [a moral issue that was not dealt with because of the larger concern of securing a new government](http://www.crf-usa.org/black-history-month/the-constitution-and-slavery). In spite of a desire by Northern states to abolish slavery as a part of the constitution, it was kept off for fear the southern states would be antagonized and unity lost. They reasoned that preserving unity was more important than dealing with slavery at that time.
1.6.4.4.1.3.2. Con: While these issues can be simultaneously addressed they must be prioritised to determine how resources should be allocated to produce the greatest benefit to all stakeholders.
1.6.4.4.1.3.3. Con: It is possible to advocate for multiple issues simultaneously. But each voter gets just one vote to fill an office with a desired candidate. If the best candidate for a global issue is different from the best candidate for some social issue, then the vote must represent the highest priority of the voter.
1.6.4.4.1.4. Con: Environmental issues are more global than the issue of, say, child poverty in the U.S., yet no one is suggesting putting the starving kids on hold until the Earth's temperature stabilises and the coral reefs come back. The hegemonic treatment of political issues is impractical and gratuitously cruel.
1.6.4.4.1.5. Pro: Identity politics demands that a policy affecting some grouping of people is the most important issue to that group of people. It demands that other concerns take a back seat. But this prevents other, clearly more important issues from more properly driving political activity e.g. war and debt are tremendously important issues that don't break down to identity groups.
1.6.4.4.2. Con: This viewpoint undermines the integrity of the individual, as it hypothesizes that group identity defines an individual more than individual characteristics, actions etc.
1.6.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.4.1.
1.6.4.6. Pro: Identity politics can cause difficulties in terms of political progress and focus.
1.6.4.6.1. Pro: For a two-party system to be effective there needs to be compromise. Identity politics makes this difficult as can be witnessed by the present state of political deadlock in the US.
1.6.5. Pro: Identity politics lead to less open dialogue and progress.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Identity politics put grievance at the source of political legitimacy. Because political actors tend to want more, rather than less power, identity politics therefore disincentivizes solving problems and working out conflicts, as doing so would reduce grievance and therefore erode the power of the aggrieved.
1.6.5.1.1. Con: The woman's suffrage movement in the US derived its political legitimacy from a grievance \(the inability to vote\). The women in the suffrage movement solved a problem, worked out a conflict, and achieved the 19th amendment.
1.6.5.1.2. Con: This is not a problem with identity politics, it is a general issue with centralised political power.
1.6.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.1.1.1.4.1.
1.6.5.2. Con: Identity politics campaigns can lead to increased dialogue and progress.
1.6.5.2.1. Pro: Campaigns to increase awareness and acceptance of same sex marriage lead to [progress.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges)
1.6.5.2.2. Pro: Campaigns to increase awareness and acceptance of same sex marriage lead to [open dialog.](http://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/) Changing opinions was done by open dialog between people and between generations.
1.6.5.3. Pro: Identity politics overemphasizes the importance of political correctness in society.
1.6.5.3.1. Pro: -> See discussion #14247: Political correctness is detrimental to society.
1.6.6. Con: What concerns society most can be very different depending on who you ask. Identity politics are a necessary means for bringing certain issues to the forefront.
1.6.6.1. Con: Forcing certain issues to the forefront of public discourse is not always a good thing, particularly when the discourse on the issues pushed is to the exclusion of discourse on other problems of a greater magnitude.
1.6.6.1.1. Pro: Forcing the public to focus on police shootings that affect at most about a thousand people per year, for instance, limits opportunities to focus on issues like climate change that will negatively affect hundreds of thousands of people.
1.6.7. Con: Identity politics is not usually discussed in isolation from all other identities. For instance, within the feminist movement, many women also fight for racial rights for those of colour. Therefore, it can be used as a source to bridge people who have similar struggles across different backgrounds or identities to promote legal and social change that benefits society.
1.6.8. Pro: Identity politics threatens constructive discourse by gatekeeping certain issues that affect a certain identity group uniquely or exclusively e.g. 'Only women have a right to address abortion'.
1.6.9. Con: Every group has the right to mobilise for their own needs. This does not mean people cannot also come together to work on issues that concern all of society.
1.7. Con: Identity politics have gotten rights recognised and protected for marginalised groups throughout history.
1.7.1. Con: Identity politics tries to solve complex problems by oversimplifying complex issues solely for the purpose of garnering political support. It fails society because the premise it is based on is that whenever we can measure an aggregate statistic, no matter how poorly-defined, and correlate that with a trivial observation about gender, sex, etc -- the second one must cause the first.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Oversimplifying statistics into one simple vector, such as "population X makes less money than population Y", implies that making money should be a primary societal goal, above other goals not considered in such a simple metric, such as participation in charities.
1.7.1.2. Pro: Oversimplifying into a one-to-one relationship, where one statistical aggregate is associated with one population, implies that there no more research or analysis is needed.
1.7.1.3. Pro: Oversimplifying population groups by some trivial easily observable characteristic, such as gender, implies that it is useful to society to group people into buckets based on the way they appear.
1.7.1.3.1. Con: The fact that an identity includes "trivial, easily observable characteristics" does not imply that those characteristics are the basis for grouping people. People are grouped because of nontrivial shared experiences and interests. For example, women may organize together politically to reduce the gender pay gap, not because they may look similar to each other.
1.7.1.3.2. Con: [Society \(particularly labor\) has historically been and is still organized by oversimplified population groups.](https://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2022&context=sulr) Identity politics provides a framework for focusing on and resolving the ways in which that fact impacts groups differently. Ultimately, identity politics seeks to solve the oversimplified way that we organize populations.
1.7.1.4. Con: Reducing a claim from identity politics to "population x suffers some malady because they bear some characteristic \(race/gender/etc.\)" is unfair to the claims made. The wage gap is a complex issue, but gender is at its core. The reasons for poverty have a lot to do with race, but identity politics does not argue that race alone is causal. These are straw men versions of identity politics.
1.7.1.5. Con: Making a claim that something is "trivial" inherently illuminates a power difference between the one making the claim and the one judged to be "trivial." Making such a judgment call creates marginalization that can significantly disadvantage those considered "trivial." The consistent wage gap between men and women is an example. This is a simple issue that refuses to be resolved through awareness, alone. Political action is frequently the only manner to address such inequity at a systemic level.
1.7.1.5.1. Con: "Trivial" is being used as a synonym for "inconsequential" only in the context of the gathering of data in the grandparent claim. The above claim uses an emotional appeal to misconstrue the word "trivial" as a societal judgment about the importance of certain types of people, but that is false provocation not an accurate reading.
1.7.1.5.2. Con: There are no people being considered trivial. The use of the word is meant as a synonym for simple, easily-measured, or immediately-apparent. The reason trivial probably works better is that the core of the claim is that two simple _statistics_ are joined together, creating a marketing opportunity for politicians. Two easily-observed things are joined together to create an easily-spoken political slogan. When we skim complex issues, "trivial" probably works better than the other alternatives.
1.7.1.6. Pro: One example might be Northern Ireland where a class struggle adopted a religious identity to each side. e.g.['A recurring theme in the history of the Irish republican struggle has been a refusal by many supporters of the national liberation struggle to accept that the class struggle is the source of the national struggle'.](https://rdln.wordpress.com/2015/06/12/ireland-the-class-struggle-is-the-source-of-the-national-struggle/)
1.7.2. Pro: [Abolishment of slavery](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/thirteenth-amendment) gave back a number of freedoms to black people in the US.
1.7.2.1. Con: Identity politics as a concept is a product of mid-20th century political activists and [intellectuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics). The abolition of slavery was driven by completely different intellectual, social and economic [paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism); Christianity for example.
1.7.3. Pro: The [women's suffrage movement](https://www.history.com/topics/womens-history/19th-amendment) won the right for women in the US to vote in 1920.
1.7.3.1. Con: Women were already gaining the right to vote in many states [prior to the adoption of the 19th amendment](https://constitutioncenter.org/timeline/html/cw08_12159.html) without a reliance on identity politics.
1.7.3.2. Con: The people who voted for women's suffrage weren't women, so it can't be considered identity politics.
1.7.3.2.1. Con: Given women organised and campaigned through the suffrage movement, it is identity politics that lead to men voting in favor of giving women voting rights.
1.7.4. Pro: [Voting rights act](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-us-history/period-8/apush-civil-rights-movement/a/the-civil-rights-act-of-1964-and-the-voting-rights-act-of-1965) restored the right to vote for African Americans.
1.7.4.1. Con: Despite that fact, African American communities are disproportionately targeted by efforts to [disenfranchise voters](https://www.aclu.org/facts-about-voter-suppression). Just because laws are on the books doesn't mean they are properly and justly enforced.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: This is evidence that identity politics is still needed, to fight for both laws and the enforcement of laws to ensure that minority rights are protected.
1.7.5. Con: Social movements campaigning for voting rights and the abolition of slavery started well before identity politics was a concept.
1.7.5.1. Con: These movements were essentially the same thing as what we now label identity politics, so it is irrelevant that the term did not yet exist.
1.7.5.2. Con: The women's suffrage movement is a form of identity politics in the same way feminism focused on equal representation in parliaments is today. If identity politics is defined in a matter that does not include social movements like mentioned above, then a big part of what is called identity politics today will have to be excluded from that definition.
1.7.6. Con: Movements such as women's suffrage and slavery abolition are not just based on identity politics. They also involve inclusive arguments based on equality and universal human rights, so retribution or restitution was not the only basis for these changes.
1.7.6.1. Con: While this statement is true, all these movements began because a set of people shared a common cause i.e. an identity, and propounded their argument to the world. The inclusive arguments being mentioned only came about because these groups felt they deserved these human rights which had been unfairly taken from them.
1.7.7. Con: That identity politics has helped disenfranchised groups doesn't justify identity politics as a whole. Not all people practicing identity politics are part of or organizing on behalf of a marginalized group. Groups which are in the majority can use identity politics to push majority issues which repress a minority.
1.7.7.1. Con: This critique demonstrates the problem of identity politics constructed to the exclusion of all other politics, but most participants in identity-based political movements also incorporate perspectives of other political views, such as class analysis or human rights theories. These approaches bring external mechanisms to evaluate which identities are in need of aid, and what kind of aid they need, and they easily falsify claims that identities such as "billionaire" or "gamer" are threatened.
1.7.8. Con: Rights have been [recognized in the West](https://www.westminster-institute.org/articles/the-superiority-of-western-values-in-eight-minutes/) and America through the very American idea that one has a certain intrinsic value regardless of their 'identity', not due to identity politics.
1.7.8.1. Pro: The [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) has given rights to every human being equally.
1.7.8.1.1. Con: The UDHR is a non-binding declaration, not legally enforceable against its signatories.
1.7.8.1.2. Con: Different identities have been denied rights granted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in their countries as the UDHR is not recognized by all countries \(see: [American Civil Rights Movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/American-civil-rights-movement)\).
1.8. Pro: Identity politics breeds division; be it racism, sexism or simple prejudice. Common humanism is a more morally justified approach to achieving justice and equality of opportunity.
1.8.1. Con: Identity politics can be seen as a form of humanism where people are valued equally by society.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Stopping police brutality is a humanistic thing to do but it can also be considered identity politics because black people are disproportionately subjected to police brutality.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: If one were to actively fight against police brutality \(something which has the potential to affect anyone, regardless of race or gender\), then marginalized groups such as African Americans would benefit from the removal of this issue. This does not need to be treated as identity politics.
1.8.1.1.1.1. Con: If improvements were to be applied universally it is still likely that African Americans would benefit less due to inherent societal prejudices, which actually demonstrates the need for identity politics. Applying improvements to police systems universally would still leave room for unnatural inequities.
1.8.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Inherent prejudices against any race, gender, religion, or country of origin will never be fully eradicated. But continuing to fight for equal rights will overtime minimize this. Identity politics creates a combative tension that only hinders that process.
1.8.1.1.2. Con: Considering stopping police brutality as a form of identity politics redefines the term. Identity politics is [defined as](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/identity%20politics) "politics in which groups of people having a particular racial, religious, ethnic, social, or cultural identity tend to promote their own specific interests or concerns without regard to the interests or concerns of any larger political group".
1.8.2. Con: Identity politics can draw people of different identities and beliefs to the same conclusion against a common oppression.
1.8.3. Pro: As one identity group strengthens, it tends to catalyze the creation or strengthening of another identity group in opposition. As feminism strengthens as an identity group, so too does male-rights advocacy. As BLM strengthens, so too does Blue Lives Matter. These opposing identity groups tend to deepen political divides.
1.8.3.1. Con: This isn't really a valid criticism of identity politics because naturally larger social movements will have detractors, whether they are explicitly related to personal identity or not.
1.8.3.2. Con: No meaningful change in society has ever happened without opposition. Not organizing for what is right for fear of opposition guarantees that we always keep the status quo, regardless of moral imperative.
1.8.4. Con: Identity politics is a reaction to division. It is not the creator of division.
1.8.5. Pro: As identity politics gets stronger so does the rise of [victim hood culture](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/the-rise-of-victimhood-culture/404794/), which divides people into sub-groups that are rewarded depending on their perceived level of victim hood. This further divides people and invalidates those with rational opinions due to them being too low on the victim-hood hierarchy.
1.9. Pro: Identity politics is incompatible with democracy.
1.9.1. Pro: Democracy is premised on an assumption that different people can reason together to arrive at a shared vision of the world, its problems, and their solutions. Identity politics is premised on a notion that it is impossible for “privileged” people to understand the lived experience of “oppressed” groups. If, as identity politics posits, it’s impossible to understand the perspective of other groups, then reasoned discourse is futile and groups can only govern other groups coercively.
1.9.1.1. Con: This roughly describes '[conflict theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conflict-theory.asp)' in sociology, not identity politics.
1.9.1.2. Con: "Identity politics" is not a singular belief system that can 'posit' anything.
1.9.1.2.1. Con: It doesn’t need to be a “singular belief system” to have this deleterious effect on democracy. When people choose their leaders based on their demographics rather than their character and ideas, the foundations of democracy are threatened.
1.9.1.3. Con: The existence of activists who claim allegiance with a marginalized identity, and who make an effort to communicate with members of privileged communities \(such as feminists throughout history, BLM, and the Human Rights Campaign\) demonstrate the widespread belief among participants in identity-based political movements that it is not impossible for the privileged to understand the oppressed, only that it is difficult.
1.9.2. Con: [Factionalism](https://www.tutor2u.net/politics/reference/factionalism), the essential elements of identity politics, is a recurring feature of all democracies.
1.9.2.1. Con: Factionalism along ideological lines sharpens the arguments of both sides and results in better policies that earn the support of the majority. Factionalism on demographic lines causes ideas to be subsumed by identity, which means bad ideas can flourish into bad policies if put forth by candidates with the “right” demographics.
1.9.3. Pro: Identity politics promote [votebanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votebank), which directly inhibit societal progress.
1.9.3.1. Pro: Societal progress requires political evolution from one generation to the next; however, the existence of votebanks implies an inherent stagnation of political motives and results.
1.9.3.1.1. Pro: [Votebanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votebank) based on either caste or religion stand in the way of secularisation.
1.9.3.2. Pro: Votebanks actively support social apathy and bitterness toward cooperation.
1.9.3.2.1. Pro: [Votebanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votebank) encourage votes on the basis of narrow communal considerations, often against their better judgement, and often at the cost of other communities.
1.9.4. Con: The premise of representative democracy is that collections of people can be reasonably represented by an individual. If identity politics are incompatible with democracy, then representation must also be incompatible with democracy, in which case few if any genuine democracies exist or have existed, especially at the scale of states or nations.
