Discussion Title: All US and EU sanctions imposed on Russia since 2014 should be lifted

1. All US and EU sanctions imposed on Russia since 2014 should be lifted
1.1. Pro: Sanctions on Russia disproportionately hurt innocent Russian citizens.
1.1.1. Con: If sanctions hurt Russian citizens, this is more likely to create popular pressure within Russia against the government's actions in Ukraine.
1.1.1.1. Con: Russians perceive the sanctions as humiliating and this has caused a [stirring of nationalist sentiment](http://www.css.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/cis/center-for-securities-studies/pdfs/PP6-4_2018.pdf) \(p.3\).
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Sanctions have helped [boost Putin's popularity](http://www.css.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/cis/center-for-securities-studies/pdfs/PP6-4_2018.pdf).
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Up to [62% of Russians believe they should adapt to life under sanctions](https://www.policycorner.org/en/2017/08/15/russia-undeterred-the-failure-of-smart-sanctions/) and there is widespread support for the government's foreign policy.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Public support of Putin has decreased the longer that sanctions are in place in Russia. [In 2018, only 58% of Russians said they supported Putin, down from 75% the year before](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-russia-sanctions-are-not-working-ukraine-azov-sea-kerch-strait-vladimir-putin/).
1.1.2. Pro: Russian citizens have not consented to, and do not support, the war in Ukraine.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Russian citizens' support for the annexation in Crimea is manufactured by a [mass media fear-mongering campaign](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/03/why-do-russians-support-interv-2014328174257483544.html) launched by the Russian Government.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The Russian Government has worked to systematically silence dissenting voices within the domestic media, through [restructuring media corporations](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25309139), [undermining independent-minded journalists](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/russia-today-anchor-liz-wahl-resigns-on-air-ukraine), and [shuttering news channels](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116434/putin-attacks-dozhdtv-russias-last-independent-tv-channel) which oppose the Government's narrative.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Putin's regime is far from a democracy, and is not defined as such by [widely accepted measures](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/russia). The citizens of Russia therefore had no ability to consent to the actions taken by their government in Ukraine.
1.1.2.3. Con: The support of Russian citizens for the annexation of Crimea holds steady at [over eighty percent.](https://themoscowtimes.com/news/70-percent-of-russians-say-crimea-annexation-was-good-for-the-country-60811) It is misleading to say that they do not support the associated war in Ukraine.
1.1.3. Con: Sanctions are deliberately [targeted](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/06/politics/russia-sanctions-oligarchs/index.html) at Russian oligarchs who support Putin, which minimises the harmful effects of sanctions on most Russians.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Forty percent of Russian business leaders say that [sanctions have hurt their business](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/426193-russia-sanctions-myths-and-lessons).
1.1.3.2. Pro: Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, was forced to [restructure the ownership and governance of his key asset, the world’s second biggest aluminium company](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/426193-russia-sanctions-myths-and-lessons), due to sanctions.
1.1.3.3. Con: The Russian government has [deliberately shifted the burden of the sanctions](https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-us-sanctions-impact-fact-check/29157163.html) from the tycoons onto the most vulnerable segments of society.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: The Russian government is moving [towards the creation of tax free zones](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-10-11/putin-baits-the-west-to-bring-russian-money-home) for Russian companies, creating a legal loophole which enables foreign entities to work with Russian companies.
1.1.3.3.2. Pro: A [tax reform](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-russia-economy-taxes/russias-policymakers-wrangle-over-how-to-meet-putins-spending-promises-idUKKBN1GY2ZS) is in the works that would raise the personal income tax rate from 13 to 15 percent, disproportionately impacting the poor.
1.1.3.3.3. Pro: Russia's Trade Minister promised to [severely punish](https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-us-sanctions-impact-fact-check/29157163.html) any Russian businesses that refused to cooperate with oligarchs sanctioned by the US.
1.1.3.3.4. Pro: The number of Russians living [below the poverty](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/poverty-in-russia-to-rise-sharply-world-bank-2016-04-06) line hit 19.8 million in 2017, up from 16.1 million in 2014.
1.1.3.4. Pro: Russian oligarchs [lost $16 billion](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-04-09/russia-s-wealthiest-people-net-worth-plummeted-video) after a fresh round of sanctions in April, 2018.
1.1.3.5. Con: Sanctions have actually [concentrated the power](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/26/new-sanctions-wont-hurt-russia-putin-oligarchs-rusal-deripaska/) of the oligarchs over the Russian economy.
1.1.3.5.1. Pro: The rise in asset prices has led [89 percent of Russian entrepreneurs](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/26/new-sanctions-wont-hurt-russia-putin-oligarchs-rusal-deripaska/) to express an intent to sell their businesses which are acquired by oligarchs; they buy these businesses at cheap prices, using low-interest rates from state-owned banks.
1.1.3.6. Con: The Kremlin has largely sheltered Russian oligarchs from the impacts of sanctions by increasing [the number of government contracts](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2015-12-14/not-so-smart-sanctions) to these oligarchs and their businesses.
1.1.3.6.1. Pro: These sanctions on Russian oligarchs only make them [more dependent on Putin](https://www.policycorner.org/en/2017/08/15/russia-undeterred-the-failure-of-smart-sanctions/), bolstering his position.
1.1.3.6.1.1. Con: Outflows by these oligarchs has [trebled in 2018, with a huge spike immediately after the April sanctions against oligarchs](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/426193-russia-sanctions-myths-and-lessons). This suggests that oligarchs are trying to distance themselves from Putin due to sanctions, not depend on him.
1.1.3.6.1.2. Con: Putin's neo-patrimonial system is dependent on a distribution of benefits such as salaried government positions which are extremely vulnerable to economic stagnation; the sanctions have [directly impacted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/08/06/heres-how-we-know-sanctions-against-russia-are-working/?utm_term=.e241b76d0246) Putin's ability to hand out these benefits.
1.1.3.6.2. Pro: From March to December 2014, companies that were linked to Putin cronies Arkady Rotenberg and Gennady Timchenko [received up to 12 percent more](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2015-12-14/not-so-smart-sanctions) in government contracts that previously before.
1.1.4. Pro: Russian citizens blame the West's sanctions for the current state of the Russian economy and the related hardships they face [\(p.1\)](https://www.jois.eu/files/2_481_Tyll%20et%20al.pdf) As a result, Putin's position is counter-productively strengthened.
1.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.1.4.2. Con: However, the longer the sanctions are in place, the more Russians want peace with the West in order to end the hardship. In 2018, [79% of the population stated that they wanted to see relations with the West normalised](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/426193-russia-sanctions-myths-and-lessons).
1.1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.1.5. Pro: While sanctions have not seriously threatened Russia's macroeconomic stability, they have [succeeded](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russia-keeps-getting-hit-with-sanctions-do-they-make-a-difference/2018/08/21/f466db1c-a3ec-11e8-ad6f-080770dcddc2_story.html?utm_term=.2fafd9357067) in cutting off the path towards further economic development.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Despite the placement of sanctions,[Russia's macroeconomic indicators have continued to improve](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russia-keeps-getting-hit-with-sanctions-do-they-make-a-difference/2018/08/21/f466db1c-a3ec-11e8-ad6f-080770dcddc2_story.html?utm_term=.2fafd9357067) - inflation and unemployment fell in 2018, as international reserves have continued to grow.
1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.4.
1.1.7. Pro: Russia has responded to sanctions with its own "counter-sanctions" on Western food imports, which have hurt poorer citizens who now spend larger percentages of their income on food \([Gould-Davies, 14](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\).
1.1.7.1. Con: Most of these Western food imports still reach Russia. They are just [rerouted through third countries like Belarus](http://www.css.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/cis/center-for-securities-studies/pdfs/PP6-4_2018.pdf).
1.1.7.1.1. Con: This rerouting still increases the average cost of food.
1.1.8. Pro: Russian responses to sanctions have increased the involvement of the state's role in the economy, which leads to more corruption and less transparency, an outcome which is worse for all Russians. \([Gould-Davies, 15](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\)
1.1.8.1. Con: Increased state involvement in the economy is leading to a nationalization of Russian banks, which may in fact make the economic system [safer](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-06-07/putin-s-under-the-radar-nationalization-of-russia-s-private-banks), by reducing the probability of high-profile bank runs and crashes.
1.1.9. Pro: Sanctions have [stopped Russian banks from borrowing](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/7/7/15928670/putin-trump-sanctions-russia) from US banks, meaning they have less capacity to pay off debts and lend out money to Russian citizens.
1.1.9.1. Pro: Visa and MasterCard [suspended all transactions from 4 major Russian banks](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2015-12-14/not-so-smart-sanctions) in response to these sanctions, effectively cancelling the credits of ordinary Russian customers.
1.1.10. Pro: Sanctions have required Moscow to slash spending on [health care, infrastructure, and government salaries](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2015-12-14/not-so-smart-sanctions), creating economic hardship for ordinary Russians.
1.1.11. Pro: The crash of the ruble in response to the sanctions has harmed savings and [increased monthly payments of those who held mortgages denominated in foreign currencies](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2015-12-14/not-so-smart-sanctions).
1.1.11.1. Con: The fall of the ruble's value has actually [been a blessing for the Russian government](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/26/new-sanctions-wont-hurt-russia-putin-oligarchs-rusal-deripaska/); Russia’s dollar inflows are driven by hydrocarbon exports, and the government’s social spending and pet projects are priced in rubles.
1.1.12. Pro: Many U.S. and European banks have [cut off many of their Russian customers](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2015-12-14/not-so-smart-sanctions) for fear of backlash to sanctions.
1.2. Pro: Sanctions have also had negative impacts on the US and EU.
1.2.1. Pro: Recent US [sanctions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/all-about-the-us-sanctions-aimed-at-putins-russia/2018/08/09/f663bd9e-9bd2-11e8-a8d8-9b4c13286d6b_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2774ccbfe255) on Russia targeting the company Rusal resulted in the disruption of the global supply chain for aluminum. This led to a global price increase of 30 percent.
1.2.2. Pro: Sanctions have increased tension between EU member states.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Italy has had [disputes](https://www.rferl.org/a/italian-deputy-prime-minister-salvini-says-rome-opposes-extension-eu-sanctions-russia-/29549946.html) with the EU over the implementation of the sanctions.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Italy has [threatened](https://euobserver.com/foreign/143207) to veto future sanctions.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Many member states including [Cyprus](https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/cyprus-parliament-calls-for-end-to-eu-sanctions-on-russia/), [Greece](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36403129) and [Hungary](https://www.france24.com/en/20180715-hungarys-orban-denounces-eu-sanctions-moscow) all have been vocal against EU sanctions.
1.2.3. Con: Sanctions on Russia have [benefited some](http://graduateinstitute.ch/home/research/research-news.html/_/news/research/2018/winners-and-losers-from-eu-sanct) EU countries e.g. Greece, Sweden and Luxembourg due to re-distributive impacts on trade.
1.2.4. Con: Trade between Russia and European countries such as Germany has begun to pick up, thus reducing the harms of sanctions on Europe. [Trade with Germany increased by roughly 23 percent in 2017.](https://www.dw.com/en/german-russian-trade-picking-up-sharply/a-42564278)
1.2.4.1. Con: However, this increased trade also undercuts both the intended economic and symbolic impact of the sanctions.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Both [exports to, and imports from, Russia rose](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Russia-EU_%E2%80%93_international_trade_in_goods_statistics#Overview) from 2015-2016 for the European Union.
1.2.5. Con: Even if the US and the EU have experienced some negative economic consequences as a result of sanctions, this is a worthy price to pay to punish Russia for its reprehensible actions.
1.2.5.1. Con: The primary moral responsibility the US and the EU member states owe is to their own constituents; the harm caused to them from the sanctions takes precedence over holding Russia accountable.
1.2.6. Pro: Sanctions have increased tensions between the US and the EU.
1.2.6.1. Pro: There is [conclusive evidence](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/16/russian-meddling-intended-to-help-trump-hurt-clinton-senate-says.html) that Russia meddled in the US Presidential elections in favour of the Trump campaign.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: Trump's [public statements and appearances](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/15/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-helsinki-russia-indictments) have caused concern among EU member states,[prompting a response](https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/1018511452242612224) from European Council President Donald Tusk which sought to admonish President Trump's claim that the EU is the United States' 'biggest foe' hours before his meeting with President Putin.
1.2.6.1.2. Pro: There is [considerable divergence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/01/10/everything-we-know-so-far-about-russian-election-meddling-in-europe/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.9be769748b2f) between the Trump Administration's and the EU's take on Russian meddling in the West's elections; while the EU leaders have spoken out openly against Russia's involvement, President Trump has been criticized for being [ambivalent](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/world/europe/trump-intelligence-russian-election-meddling-.html) on the issue.
1.2.6.2. Pro: President Trump has [continued to deny](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/16/heres-where-trump-has-been-tough-on-russia--and-where-hes-backed-do.html) any instance of Russian meddling during the US Presidential Election.
1.2.6.3. Pro: President Trump has been [ambivalent](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/08/trump-calls-for-russia-to-be-included-in-meetings-of-powers-like-g-7.html) about the legality of the annexation of Crimea; this has [caused concern](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/26/politics/russia-ukraine-trump-silence/index.html) among EU allies and [cast doubt](https://euobserver.com/foreign/142331) on US Foreign Policy with regards to engagement with Russia.
1.2.6.4. Pro: The Trump Administration has [attempted](https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&jsonp=vglnk_154974372990113&key=a426d7531bff1ca375d5930dea560b93&libId=jrxxeggd0102i8oq000DA4n04p931&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fedition.cnn.com%2F2019%2F01%2F15%2Fpolitics%2Fsenate-vote-russia-sanctions-trump%2Findex.html&v=1&out=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2018%2F12%2F19%2Fpolitics%2Fus-treasury-russia%2Findex.html&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.uk%2F&title=Trump%27s%20plan%20to%20ease%20Russia%20sanctions%20to%20be%20challenged%20in%20Senate%20Democrats%20vote%20-%20CNNPolitics&txt=plan%20to%20ease%20sanctions%20on%20three%20companies%20with%20ties%20to%20Russian%20oligarch%20Oleg%20Deripaska) to ease Russian sanctions over Ukraine this year; such [divergences](http://www.epc.eu/pub_details.php?cat_id=4&pub_id=8517) in the sanctions regime has created [outrage](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/31/europe-us-russia-sanctions-putin-washington-eu-donald-trump) in the EU and led to a 'breaking of the ranks' in the Western coalition's stance on Russia.
1.2.6.5. Pro: The EU and the Trump Administration have had [significant disagreements](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/31/europe-us-russia-sanctions-putin-washington-eu-donald-trump) over the timing and structure of the Russian sanctions regime.
1.2.7. Pro: Sanctions to Russia have cut growth in Europe by [0.3 percent of GDP](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2015-12-14/not-so-smart-sanctions) in 2015.
1.2.7.1. Pro: Russia is the second largest market for the EU's agri-food products. \([Christen et al, 2017, p. 5](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/603847/EXPO_STU\(2017\)603847_EN.pdf)\)
1.2.7.2. Pro: Sanctions - coupled with other external factors weakening the Russian economy - have led to an annual contraction of 20.7% in trade between Russia and the EU from 2013 to 2016. \([Christen et al, 2017, p. 6](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/603847/EXPO_STU\(2017\)603847_EN.pdf)\)
1.2.8. Pro: Continuing sanctions on Russia will cost Europe over [90 billion euros in export revenue](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2015-12-14/not-so-smart-sanctions) and more than[two million jobs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2015-12-14/not-so-smart-sanctions) over the next few years.
1.2.8.1. Con: While shifting distribution routes will take some time, alternative trading markets in agricultural goods for the EU exist. [\(Fritz et. al, 2017, p. 24](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/603847/EXPO_STU\(2017\)603847_EN.pdf)\)
1.2.8.2. Pro: Russia ranks as the EU's third trading partner \(representing 8.4% of total trade\). \([Szczepański, 2015, p.2](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2015/569020/EPRS_BRI\(2015\)569020_EN.pdf)\)
1.2.8.3. Pro: Germany stands to lose [almost 400,000 jobs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2015-12-14/not-so-smart-sanctions) due to these sanctions.
1.2.8.3.1. Pro: Russia is a [critical market](https://www.ft.com/content/d6785134-3f2a-11e8-b7e0-52972418fec4) for German companies; German companies exported €25.8bn worth of goods to Russia in 2015 before sanctions intensified.
1.2.8.3.2. Pro: EU and US sanctions have impacted the ability of German companies to finance business in Russia, as German banks [have retreated](https://www.ft.com/content/d6785134-3f2a-11e8-b7e0-52972418fec4) from Moscow since the sanctions kicked in.
1.3. Con: The lifting of sanctions on Russia will escalate the conflict in Ukraine and lead to more casualties.
1.3.1. Pro: Russia is rapidly annexing Ukrainian territory; in January 2019 it seized [unilateral control](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/18/its-time-to-stand-up-to-russias-aggression-in-ukraine/) of the strategically important Kerch Strait after firing on Ukrainian ships and wounding Ukrainian soldiers.
1.3.2. Pro: More than 10,000 people have been killed in the [conflict in Eastern Ukraine.](https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/10/11/an-end-to-the-war-in-eastern-ukraine-looks-as-far-away-as-ever)
1.3.3. Pro: Without the concerted efforts of the international community to deter Russia's actions, the Ukrainian state [will be left alone](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/30/europe/ukraine-russia-paton-walsh-intl/index.html) to engage the more powerful Russian military.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Ukrainian military strength is [dwarfed](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-vs-ukraine-military-comparison-war-1234367) by Russia's in all aspects of warfare.
1.3.4. Con: Sanctions have only [escalated the situation](https://jamestown.org/program/russia-defends-the-minsk-agreements-and-status-quo-in-ukraines-east/) in the Ukraine and emboldened further Russian action.
1.3.5. Pro: An escalated conflict in Ukraine is likely to drive the government towards authoritarianism at the detriment of Ukrainian citizens.
1.3.5.1. Pro: The Ukrainian state has began to take drastic steps such as the [imposition of martial law](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-s-martial-law-over-there-s-no-end-sight-n952211) in response to Russian aggression which threaten the liberties of Ukrainian citizens.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Elections for the Presidency - due to be held in March, 2019 - [cannot be held](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-s-martial-law-over-there-s-no-end-sight-n952211) if the country is under martial law; a dangerous precedent for imposing martial law in the interest of national security has already been set in 2018.
1.3.5.3. Pro: According to polling organisation Rating Group Ukraine, [60% of Ukrainian citizens](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-s-martial-law-over-there-s-no-end-sight-n952211) opposed the imposition of martial law last year.
1.3.5.4. Pro: The far-right Svoboda Party - populated by radical Ukrainian nationalists - is [gaining political ground](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/01/ukraine-maidan-protests-elections-volodymyr-ishchenko) in Ukraine; further conflict with Russia will [empower far-right movements](https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/ukraine%20brief%20final.pdf) by allowing them to present Russia as an existential threat that the current government has been unable to deter.
1.4. Pro: Sanctions have been, and will continue to be, ineffective at changing Russia's behaviour.
1.4.1. Pro: The longer sanctions are in place, the [less likely they are to produce any policy change](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2015-12-14/not-so-smart-sanctions).
1.4.1.1. Pro: The perceived failure of sanctions may in fact embolden Russia to take more aggressive action in the future because Moscow knows that sanctions have exhausted their effect.
1.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.
1.4.2. Pro: The Russian government's use of propaganda has been very effective in keeping public opinion in line with Russia's interests.
1.4.2.1. Pro: The Russian government has had large success in painting sanctions as an [attack](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/563ae0_589509cefef44e3598c298ab8b92799b.pdf) on Russia by western countries \(p.3\).
1.4.2.2. Pro: The Russian government pushes narratives that directly contradict what Western media and governments say, making Russian citizens suspicious of what Western media has to say.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Russia claims its [bombing](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/syria-war-russia-insists-its-warplanes-are-bombing-isis-targets-n436736) in Syria targets terrorists, not civilians.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Russia has [blamed MI6](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-russia-spy/russian-spy-chief-blames-u-s-british-agencies-for-skripal-poisoning-idUKKCN1HB0T2) for the Skripal poisoning, declaring it an act of provocation.
1.4.2.2.3. Pro: Russian media was utilised to propogandise Georgian atrocities in South Ossetia and create support for the Russian intervention in Georgia in 2008. \([Donovan, 2009, p. 21](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a500627.pdf)\)
1.4.2.2.4. Pro: According to a [nationwide study](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ru/Documents/research-center/media-consumption-in-russia-2018-en.pdf), only 7% of respondents in Russia indicated a preference for foreign websites as a key source of information.
1.4.2.2.5. Pro: The majority of Russians \(59%\) [prefer information](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ru/Documents/research-center/media-consumption-in-russia-2018-en.pdf) from Russian sources.
1.4.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.4.2.4. Pro: Russia has previously [covered up](https://taskandpurpose.com/russia-mercenaries-syria-defeat-details) the death toll of troops involved in the Syrian conflict.
1.4.2.5. Pro: Russia has adopted increasingly sophisticated social media techniques, including sophisticated trolling on news sites, fake hashtag and Twitter campaigns, and the close coordination between social media operations and other media.\([Helmus et al, 2018, p. 2](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR2200/RR2237/RAND_RR2237.pdf)\)
1.4.3. Con: Sanctions indicate the [unity](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/2015/russia/sanctions-after-crimea-have-they-worked/en/index.htm) of the EU, the US and their allies against Russian aggression. As a result, they send a powerful signal that further aggressive action by Russia will be met with a coordinated and unified response.
1.4.3.1. Con: A similar message could have been sent without the use of heavy-handed tactics like sanctions.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: There are others methods the EU and US could use to control Russia's behaviour.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: The creation of the EU's proposed [Energy Union](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/infographs/energy/bloc-1.html) and the diversification of its [reliance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenrwald/2018/07/11/trump-is-right-about-russian-energy-and-heres-what-he-can-do-about-it/#4544a875834b) on Russian gas would reduce the leverage Russia currently has in international disputes.
1.4.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Russia has previously [threatened](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/10684333/Putin-mocks-the-West-and-threatens-to-turn-off-gas-supplies.html) to turn off gas pipelines to Europe during disputes.
1.4.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It is unlikely that Russia would follow up on this threat because of the [contracting market value of Gazprom](https://www.ft.com/content/62bfc776-d37e-11e7-8c9a-d9c0a5c8d5c9) and its dependence on Europe as a reliable importer.
1.4.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Germany's construction of the proposed Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline will significantly [increase](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/11/germany-and-russia-gas-links-trump-questions-europe-nord-stream2) the EU's reliance on Russian gas, making this aim unlikely to occur.
1.4.3.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Despite pressure from the US and other EU members, [all signs point towards German companies](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-usa-russia-pipeline/us-warns-german-companies-of-possible-sanctions-over-russian-pipeline-idUSKCN1P70FR) continuing the construction of the pipeline.
1.4.3.1.1.2. Pro: [International condemnations](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/nov/26/russia-ukraine-kerch-strait-incident-draws-interna/) against Russia's actions in Ukraine have and can be used in the future to check Russia's behaviour.
1.4.3.1.1.3. Con: Other methods do little to curtail Russia's illegal actions in Ukraine in the short-term.
1.4.3.1.1.4. Pro: The West's presence in Ukraine helps to deter Russian misbehaviour in the country. Increasing this presence would help to deter Russia in the future.
1.4.3.1.1.4.1. Pro: The US currently [sells weapons](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/us-steps-up-arms-sales-to-ukraine-by-sending-210-antitank-missiles/news-story/c73bae6e870404021428cae414a7c32b?nk=60242afd4f7185803c9b8944591a15e5-1549304931) and [military hardware](https://uawire.org/ukraine-to-receive-patrol-boats-from-the-us-in-2019) to Ukraine to allow it to better deter Russian aggression.
1.4.3.1.1.4.2. Pro: The [deployment](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/29/russia-blocked-ukrainian-azov-sea-ports-minister) of NATO ships into the Sea of Azov would help stop the blockading of Ukraine.
1.4.3.1.1.4.3. Con: NATO has [already increased](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-12/04/c_137648543.htm) its presence in the Black Sea in recent years. This has not deterred [Russian aggression](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46338671).
1.4.3.1.1.4.4. Pro: Increasing the [power](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/cheap-ways-to-make-putin-pay-in-ukraine) of the Ukrainian Navy would reduce the likelihood of further aggression.
1.4.3.1.1.4.4.1. Pro: The US and EU recently [pledged](https://www.rferl.org/a/us-britain-lithuania-nato-pledge-support-ukraine-navy-russia-attack/29670500.html) to increase their support of the Ukrainian Navy.
1.4.3.1.1.4.4.2. Pro: Russia currently has [maritime dominance](https://warontherocks.com/2019/01/the-naval-power-shift-in-the-black-sea/) within the Black Sea. Increasing Ukraine's power would help to counteract this.
1.4.3.1.1.4.5. Pro: [Allowing](http://neweasterneurope.eu/2018/05/18/case-ukraines-membership-nato/) Ukraine into NATO would help to deter Russian aggression due to NATO's policy of [collective defense](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm).
1.4.3.1.1.4.5.1. Pro: Ukraine has support from many states to join NATO, including the [US](https://www.uawire.org/kyiv-us-supports-ukraine-joining-nato).
1.4.3.1.1.4.5.2. Con: There is also strong [opposition](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/ukraine-should-not-be-member-nato-37287) against Ukraine joining NATO.
1.4.3.1.1.4.5.2.1. Pro: Within Germany, the [majority of citizens](http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/10/nato-publics-blame-russia-for-ukrainian-crisis-but-reluctant-to-provide-military-aid/russia-ukraine-report-30/) do not support Ukraine joining NATO.
1.4.3.1.1.4.5.2.2. Pro: Canada has previously [said](https://www.unian.info/politics/10182599-canada-s-ambassador-nato-unready-to-commence-membership-talks-with-ukraine.html) that NATO is not ready to accept Ukraine.
1.4.3.2. Con: The [sanctions regime has created a fragile sense of unity,](https://euobserver.com/opinion/142434) tested repeatedly by biannual approval and threatened by the Russia-friendly agenda of various EU political actors.
1.4.4. Con: Sanctions may not have pressured Russia to reverse their actions, but they have helped [reduce the intensity of Russian aggression](https://euobserver.com/foreign/144072) to some extent.
1.4.4.1. Con: It is impossible to prove or disprove whether sanctions had an effect on something that Russia did not do. US and EU policy should therefore be based on measurable outcomes. From that perspective, sanctions have clearly failed.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Sanctions on Russian businesses such as Rusal and EN+, which are Russia's largest producer of aluminium, limited their ability to [produce Russian war machine in countries such as Ukraine, Syria, and Georgia](https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/426071-the-case-for-russia-sanctions).
1.4.4.3. Pro: Russia's illegal actions, such as intervening in the Ukrainian elections, are [very costly projects](https://euobserver.com/foreign/144072). Sanctions can limit the amount of money that Russia has to engage in illegal actions, thus reducing their capacity to do harm.
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: In order to intervene in the 2019 Ukrainian elections, Russia has to pay the Russian special services [$350m](https://euobserver.com/foreign/144072).
1.4.4.3.2. Pro: Russia spends money feeding and arming the [32,000 fighters that Ukraine says Russia has in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic \(DPR\) and Luhansk People's Republic \(LPR\)](https://euobserver.com/foreign/144072) in Russia-occupied east-Ukraine.
1.4.5. Con: A significant part of Russia's economic elite is more deeply tied to and dependent on the global economic and financial system than its own national one. Sanctions are likely to pressure these elites into changing state policy. \([Gould-Davies, 8](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\)
1.4.5.1. Pro: Easy access to Western economic, financial, and legal services has been a key means of protecting elite interests in Russia. \([Gould-Davies, 16](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\)
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: Russian oligarchs stashed their money in [Swiss bank accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_oligarch) rather than in the local economy in the 90s.
1.4.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.6.1.
1.4.5.3. Pro: High ranking [elites](https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/russian-concerns-over-sanctions-are-growing#) have begun to call for Russia to improve their relationship with neighbours, citing sanctions as the main reason for this.
1.4.5.3.1. Pro: The threat of sanctions has stopped countries and international companies from trading with Russian oligarchs for fear of repercussions on themselves.
1.4.5.3.1.1. Pro: A Russian company controlled by sanctioned billionaire Alexei Mordashov has struggled to build an $900 million power plant in Vietnam after [Vietnamese companies were unwilling to work with companies under U.S. sanctions](https://thebell.io/en/fear-of-collateral-damage-from-sanctions-is-jeopardizing-the-kremlin-s-pivot-to-asia/). As a result, payments have been frozen and 15 key contractors are refusing to work.
1.4.5.4. Con: Sanctions against [oligarchs](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/caatsa.aspx) are [not linked](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-sanctions-against-russia-what-you-need-know) to any discernible policy objectives. The failure to identify what success would look like for these sanctions is an indication of their uselessness.
1.4.5.4.1. Con: Sanctions do not always require clear policy objectives - they can be applied for the purpose of expressing negative sentiment, or calling out a nation/individuals for their unethical practises.
1.4.6. Con: US sanctions on Russian business leaders for not abiding by sanctions placed on North Korea have been [effective](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-sanctions-against-russia-what-you-need-know) at cutting North Korea out from the global financial system.
1.4.7. Pro: Sanctions have not succeeded in their ultimate goal of inducing Russia to reach a political settlement. The Minsk Agreements, as negotiated by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French President Francois Hollande between Russia and Ukraine, have still not been implemented. \([Gould-Davies, 12](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\)
1.4.7.1. Pro: Effective enforcement of the [Minsk Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk_Protocol) was and is the clearest path to stop fighting and death in Ukraine.
1.4.7.2. Pro: The ['security' elements](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/03/10/minsk-iis-future-looks-bleak-but-whats-the-alternative/) of the agreement called for a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons from the line of contact, and access for monitors from the OSCE.
1.4.7.3. Pro: The ['political' elements](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/02/15/minsk-ii-at-two-years/) of the agreement called for decentralisation of power, an election law for the occupied part of the Donbas, and special status for that region.
1.4.7.4. Pro: As of January 2019, the agreement is [yet to be implemented](https://jamestown.org/program/russia-defends-the-minsk-agreements-and-status-quo-in-ukraines-east/) by the two concerned parties.
1.4.8. Pro: Sanctions cannot meaningfully damage Russia economically.
1.4.8.1. Con: According to Ukraine's foreign intelligence service, Western sanctions have cost the Russian budget [$173bn already](https://112.international/ukraine-and-eu/anti-russian-sanctions-have-bigger-effect-ukraines-spy-chief-36657.html).
1.4.8.1.1. Pro: If this is true, this would amount to [half of Russia's state budget for 2019](https://www.unian.info/world/10432959-ukraine-spy-chief-says-sanctions-hurting-putin-s-war-chest-euobserver.html), which is a serious harm for Russia.
1.4.8.1.2. Con: This figure is massively larger than that reported or estimated by all [American and European think-tanks](https://www.unian.info/world/10432959-ukraine-spy-chief-says-sanctions-hurting-putin-s-war-chest-euobserver.html), creating some doubt regarding its credibility.
1.4.8.2. Con: The sanctions were not designed to cripple Russia economically, but rather to target [specific industries](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1) within the country \(pg.11\).
1.4.8.3. Con: Due to the economic difficulties faced by Russia, Putin has been forced to [raise](https://www.ft.com/content/43b3ead4-6fe0-11e8-92d3-6c13e5c92914) Russia's pension age which has had a large [impact](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/11/28/putin-doesnt-sweat-his-unpopularity/) on his popularity.
1.4.8.3.1. Con: In the [absence of sufficient domestic political opposition](https://www.afr.com/news/politics/world/russias-imitation-democracy-and-its-illusory-opposition-and-representation-20180115-h0ie8m), low approval ratings may not be politically harmful for Putin.
1.4.8.3.2. Con: Putin's approval ratings still hover [above 60%](https://themoscowtimes.com/news/putins-approval-rating-lowest-since-2013-poll-63301) despite the new changes to pension policies.
1.4.8.3.3. Con: The economic difficulties which have forced Putin to raise Russia's pension age have little do with the sanctions - [Russia's ageing population made this policy change an economic inevitability.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/vladimir-putin-russian-pension-reform-duma-ratings-a8454661.html)
1.4.8.4. Con: Economic sanctions have in part forced Russia to cut its military spending by [20%](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-despite-ventures-syria-ukraine-cut-military-spending-last-year-most-since-1998-economic-collapse-western-sanctions-recession/29203634.html).
1.4.8.4.1. Con: Sanctions were imposed in 2014, but Russia continued increasing its military budget from [2015-16.](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-despite-ventures-syria-ukraine-cut-military-spending-last-year-most-since-1998-economic-collapse-western-sanctions-recession/29203634.html)
1.4.8.5. Pro: Russia's credit rating has been [upgraded](https://www.ft.com/content/ffa87cec-2beb-11e9-88a4-c32129756dd8) recently due to its ability to survive external shocks such as sanctions.
1.4.8.6. Pro: To truly hurt Russia's economy, it would be necessary to heavily sanction their energy sector. However, the global energy market's dependence on Russian oil and gas makes this unthinkable. \([Gould-Davies, 8](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\)
1.4.8.6.1. Con: Russia's energy sector has already been seriously harmed as Russia's oil and gas industry are dependent on foreign money and technology which have been [restricted by sanctions](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/426193-russia-sanctions-myths-and-lessons).
1.4.8.6.1.1. Con: However, the impact of these restrictions would only hurt the economy [two or three years in the future, when the companies are unable to reach their development goals.](https://www.dw.com/en/western-sanctions-on-russia-lots-of-noise-and-little-impact/a-43271200)
1.4.8.6.2. Pro: Major Western companies also participate in Russia's most significant oil and gas projects, making a sanction even less likely. \([Gould-Davies, 8](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\)
1.4.8.7. Pro: By virtue of Russia being a major power, Western sanctions are unlikely to be able to isolate Russia in the same way that they might do to a smaller or weaker nation. \([Gould-Davies, 8](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\)
1.4.8.7.1. Pro: Western sanctions are likely to make Russia turn to trade relationships with countries like China.
1.4.8.7.1.1. Pro: The US-China trade war has presented Russia as a viable trading partner for China, with which trade has [dramatically increased](https://www.cfr.org/blog/trumps-trade-war-china-makes-russia-great-again) over the past year.
1.4.8.7.1.2. Con: Russia's trade relationship with China [revolves around oil and gas](https://www.economist.com/china/2017/07/27/xi-jinping-and-vladimir-putin-behave-like-the-best-of-buddies), and shall exist irrespective of Western sanctions.
1.4.8.7.1.3. Con: The relationship between China and Russia is much weaker than the relationship Russia has with the West. [Less than 1% of China’s foreign direct investment goes to Russia](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/426193-russia-sanctions-myths-and-lessons).
1.4.8.7.1.3.1. Pro: China has shown [little interest in Russian industrial products except for arms](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/putins-pivot-why-russia-is-looking-east/), and even that [demand has stalled in recent years](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/putins-pivot-why-russia-is-looking-east/) due to sanctions.
1.4.8.7.1.3.2. Pro: Russia often appears to regard Beijing as the investor of last resort, [turning to China only when all other possibilities have been exhausted.](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/putins-pivot-why-russia-is-looking-east/)
1.4.8.7.1.3.2.1. Pro: Russia [consistently refuses to allow Chinese companies to acquire substantial equity in Russian energy projects,](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/putins-pivot-why-russia-is-looking-east/) limiting the role of China as a trade partner.
1.4.8.7.1.4. Con: China is too [frightened of collateral damage from sanctions](https://thebell.io/en/fear-of-collateral-damage-from-sanctions-is-jeopardizing-the-kremlin-s-pivot-to-asia/) to meaningfully support Russia's “pivot to Asia” with anything more than words.
1.4.8.7.1.4.1. Pro: The U.S. and Europe account for [up to 90% of Chinese banks’ foreign transactions](https://thebell.io/en/fear-of-collateral-damage-from-sanctions-is-jeopardizing-the-kremlin-s-pivot-to-asia/). Russia’s share is too small for China to risk sanctions.
1.4.8.7.1.4.2. Pro: Russian officials have complained that banks in China are either [delaying or blocking transaction with Russian companies](https://thebell.io/en/fear-of-collateral-damage-from-sanctions-is-jeopardizing-the-kremlin-s-pivot-to-asia/) to protect themselves from Western sanctions.
1.4.8.7.1.5. Con: Russia’s pivot towards China and the East is mostly talk; [its population is mostly in the West, its economic ties are mostly to the West, and its official military doctrine remains fixated on the United States and NATO.](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/putins-pivot-why-russia-is-looking-east/)
1.4.8.7.1.6. Pro: China has become [increasingly supportive of Russia in the United Nations Security Council](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/putins-pivot-why-russia-is-looking-east/).
1.4.8.7.1.7. Pro: China stepped in to support the Yamal gas project, enabling Russia to showcase it as a successful defiance of sanctions. \([Gould-Davies, 14](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\)
1.4.8.7.1.7.1. Con: These are often empty promises. China and Russia have concluded no less than six agreements for gas trade between 2004 and 2013, but have [yet to reach a deal on actual deliveries.](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/putins-pivot-why-russia-is-looking-east/)
1.4.8.7.1.7.1.1. Con: The time period discussed is from before the implementation of sanctions. Both Russia and China have developed worse relationships with the West since then, making it likelier that they will engage in actual meaningful trade relationships.
1.4.8.7.1.8. Pro: In October 2014, Russia and China agreed to a [150 billion yuan currency swap](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2015-12-14/not-so-smart-sanctions) which allowed Russian businesses to trade in rubles and yuan, thus avoiding U.S. financial regulations.
1.4.8.7.2. Con: America's structural power in the global economy is immense - its sanctions on the aluminum company Rusal disrupted aluminum prices, triggered board resignations, and caused massive crashes in company stock. \([Gould-Davies, 10](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\)
1.4.8.7.3. Con: Russia's relationship with the global economy has weakened in the face of sanctions.
1.4.8.7.3.1. Pro: Lending from all major countries has declined drastically. \([Gould-Davies, 11](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\)
1.4.8.7.3.2. Pro: Foreign bank exposure and FDI inflows have both halved since 2013. \([Gould-Davies, 11](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\)
1.4.8.8. Pro: Russia's trade dependence is limited, with trade accounting for about 40% of its GDP. Sanctions will not cripple the Russian economy. \([Gould-Davies, 8](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\)
1.4.8.8.1. Pro: Sanctions from 2014-17 are estimated to have reduced Russian GDP by a paltry 2-2.5%. \([Gould-Davies, 11](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\)
1.4.8.8.2. Con: The Russian economy is projected to grow by 1.5-1.7% a year till 2023, a figure substantially lower than the global growth rate of 3.7-3.9% and even the developed country average growth rate of 1.5-2.5% \([Gould-Davies, 11](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\)
1.4.8.9. Con: The effects of sanctions on Russia are likely to accumulate over time to the point that they begin to cause immense damage later.
1.4.8.9.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.
1.4.8.9.2. Pro: Shell suspended plans to develop the Bazhenov shale with Gazpromneft, delaying the ability of the Russian company to develop shale oil by several years. \([Gould-Davies, 11](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\)
1.4.8.9.3. Pro: The threat of more severe sanctions also being imposed in response to Russian escalation keeps said escalation from taking place.
1.4.8.10. Pro: Russia has responded to sanctions through increased flexibility: it has lowered dependence on the dollar, finding ways to support access of sanctioned companies to the domestic financial market, and drawing up measures to reduce dependence on foreign patent holders. \([Gould-Davies, 13](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\)
1.4.8.11. Con: Sanctions may not have undermined Russia's macroeconomic stability, but they have cut off paths to development for [Russia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russia-keeps-getting-hit-with-sanctions-do-they-make-a-difference/2018/08/21/f466db1c-a3ec-11e8-ad6f-080770dcddc2_story.html?utm_term=.5668e6876819) by decelerating growth rates and preventing the Russian economy from undergoing structural reform.
1.4.8.11.1. Con: By limiting growth, but not undermining the fundamental stability of the Russian economy, sanctions are the worst of both worlds. Citizens are denied the economic growth associated [with democracy](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2391678) and are simultaneously not disturbed to the extent that the Putin regime is threatened.
1.4.8.11.2. Pro: If Russia's aggressive and revisionist behavior is to continue, it is better that its economic capacity is limited so its military strength is weakened.
1.4.8.11.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.
1.4.8.11.3. Con: If sanctions only reduce possible growth, while inflation, unemployment and foreign reserves remain at [acceptable if not exceptional](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russia-keeps-getting-hit-with-sanctions-do-they-make-a-difference/2018/08/21/f466db1c-a3ec-11e8-ad6f-080770dcddc2_story.html?utm_term=.5668e6876819) levels, then it is unlikely that sanctions will result in the internal political pressure required to stop Russian international aggression.
1.4.8.12. Pro: If the price of oil [rises again in the next few years, as is likely](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2015-12-14/not-so-smart-sanctions), Russia will be further able to protect themselves from sanctions.
1.4.8.12.1. Pro: Russia is [currently](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/opec-wants-to-formalize-its-pact-with-russia-2019-02-05) in talks with OPEC on forming a new partnership. This would give Russia more control over the global price of oil.
1.4.8.12.2. Con: Some [experts](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/06/07/the-case-for-russia-sanctions/) believe that even a large increase in oil prices will not help fix the structural issues in the Russian economy.
1.4.8.12.3. Con: Oil prices are [projected to fall](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Why-Oil-Prices-Will-Fall-In-2019-And-Beyond.html) in 2019 and beyond.
1.4.9. Pro: Russia has committed many illegal actions since the implementation of sanctions by the EU and US.
1.4.9.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.3.
1.4.9.2. Pro: Russia has [conducted](https://www.cna.org/CNA_files/PDF/COP-2018-U-017903-Final.pdf) massive airstrikes in Syria, killing thousands to support Syrian leader Bashar Al-Assad.
1.4.9.3. Pro: Russia has attempted to influence elections in the [US](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/01/how-russia-helped-to-swing-the-election-for-trump) and the [EU](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-election-2017-russia-hacked-cyberattacks/).
1.4.9.4. Pro: Russia has [committed](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russians-charged-over-novichok-poisoning-sergei-skripal-daughter-n906466) illegal assassinations on foreign soil.
1.4.9.5. Pro: Russia still [occupies Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_intervention_in_Ukraine_\(2014%E2%80%93present\)) and continues to intervene militarily in eastern Ukraine.
1.4.9.5.1. Con: However, sanctions appear to have curbed Russian escalation. Waves of sanctions in 2014 stopped the Russian offensive against the practically defenseless Mariupol. \([41](https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/Report_25_EU_Sanctions.pdf)\)
1.4.9.5.2. Pro: Russia recently [fired upon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/27/kerch-strait-confrontation-what-happened-ukrainian-russia-crimea) and captured Ukrainian warships.
1.5. Con: Sanctions are the morally right thing to do in order to punish Russia for its immoral, and at times illegal, behaviour.
1.5.1. Con: Sanctions only inflict further suffering on Russian citizens, without deterring the Russian state.
1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.5.1.2. Pro: The Russian state and Russian citizenry are [inseparable](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/26/new-sanctions-wont-hurt-russia-putin-oligarchs-rusal-deripaska/); 80 percent of the Russian economy either belongs to the state or is controlled through so-called oligarchs who are essentially appointees of the regime. About 38 percent of the workforce is employed by the state itself.
1.5.2. Pro: Boris Nemtsov was [killed](https://4freerussia.org/putin.war/Putin.War-Eng.pdf) after he was about to publish all the criminal acts that Putin’s Russia committed.
1.5.3. Pro: Russia was complicit in the death of over 300 civilians as a result of the downing of commercial flight [MH17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_17). There are almost no other [ways](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/16/russia-must-account-for-role-in-shooting-down-mh17-says-g7) to symbolically hold Russia to account other than sanctions.
1.5.3.1. Pro: [Dutch prosecutors identified](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17/investigators-identify-russian-military-unit-in-downing-of-flight-mh17-idUSKCN1IP0TR) a Russian military unit as the source of the missile brought down MH17.
1.5.3.2. Pro: The Russian government has been [evasive](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-05-25/putin-s-evasions-on-flight-mh-17-are-a-disgrace) in discussing responsibility for the MH17 incident.
1.5.3.3. Con: Asian countries - which should be most aggrieved by the MH17 incident - have in most cases [refused to sanction](https://thediplomat.com/2014/07/why-asia-wont-sanction-russia-for-mh17/) Russia.
1.5.4. Pro: Russia's actions led to [thousands of deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Ukrainian_crisis) when it initiated the crisis in the Ukraine in 2014. Sanctions indicate to Russia and the wider international community that those actions were abhorrent and wrong.
1.5.4.1. Con: Having hosted both the [2014 Winter Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Winter_Olympics) and the [2018 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup) despite sanctions, it is clear that sanctions have failed to render Russia a pariah in the international community.
1.5.5. Pro: Russia's annexation of Crimea was a [clear violation](https://www.unian.info/politics/10201878-russian-annexation-of-crimea-violates-norms-of-international-law-german-fm.html) of international law. If international law is to have any legitimacy, the West needs to show that there are consequences for breaking it.
1.5.5.1. Con: Without [the capacity to succesfully enforce punishments](https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/international-law/can-international-law-be-called-true-law-international-law-essay.php) in most instances, the credibility of international law is already low. Whether sanctions were imposed on Russia or not would have had little effect on the overall legitimacy of international law.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: If anything, sanctions further undermine the credibility of international law since they are being placed by the EU and the United States without recourse to any of the official organs of international law.
1.5.5.1.1.1. Con: While there is little enforcement power vested in this organ of the UN, the General Assembly - hosting representatives from every UN member - voted [in favour of a resolution condemning Russia's annexation of Crimea](https://www.un.org/press/en/2018/ga12108.doc.htm); hence, the international community and its organs support the sanctions placed by the US and EU on Russia.
1.5.5.1.1.2. Con: The official organs of international law are vested in the UN Security Council, where Russia has a veto vote which it uses frequently [to protect itself and its allies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nikki-haley-says-new-sanctions-coming-on-russia/2018/04/15/4aad784c-5bb3-45db-b7d4-970d428bef6f_story.html?utm_term=.22588e422b7b); hence, the official organs of international law have been disabled by Russia from taking action against it.
1.5.5.2. Pro: The [majority of members](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/infographics/countries-react-to-russian-intervention-in-crimea.html) of the international community have condemned Russia's annexation of Crimea as a violation of international law.
1.5.5.3. Pro: Past intergovernmental organisations such as the League of Nations suffered from a crisis of legitimacy due to an inability to enforce international law.\([Northedge, 1986](https://www.questia.com/library/78758358/the-league-of-nations-its-life-and-times-1920-1946)\).
1.5.6. Con: States, including the [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_war_crimes), constantly violate international law and commit morally dubious acts. It is hypocritical to single out Russia.
1.5.6.1. Pro: The US-led invasion in Iraq [has given Putin space to cast aspersions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/whataboutism-what-about-it/2017/08/17/4d05ed36-82b4-11e7-b359-15a3617c767b_story.html?utm_term=.01ea8634883a) on the West's intentions with regards to the protection of the international community.
1.6. Pro: Sanctions make Russia more aggressive; peace in the international community would best be achieved by reconciling with Russia, for which sanctions need to be removed.
1.6.1. Pro: Western sanctions alienate Russia and cause it to seek an alternate international bloc. The creation of said bloc leads to increased tensions in the international community.
1.6.1.1. Con: Russia's desire to form an alternate international bloc stems from the [legacy of the Cold War](https://www.historyextra.com/period/cold-war/did-cold-war-us-russia-relations-ever-really-end-soviet-union-america-tensions-nuclear-weapons/), and predates the enforcement of sanctions on Russia by the US and EU.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Even if this is true, sanctions hasten the process by forcing Russia to need this bloc more rapidly.
1.6.1.1.2. Con: During [Obama's first term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia%E2%80%93United_States_relations), Russia-US relations were improving, implying that the deterministic argument about the legacy of the Cold War is not true.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Blocs and alliance systems have a tendency to generate tensions and conflict.
1.6.1.2.1. Pro: Being a part of [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Bloc) or the [Warsaw Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc) during the Cold War would involve countries in patterns of alliance and enmity that increased mutual tensions.
1.6.1.2.2. Pro: World War One only developed to the scale that it did because of the relics of a Bismarckian [system of alliances](https://blogs.baruch.cuny.edu/his1005spring2011/2011/03/02/the-cause-of-a-world-war-the-alliance-system/) in Europe.
1.6.1.2.3. Con: The network of alliance structures in the 21st century have created a complex web of ties, reducing the probability of conflict and increasing international cooperation due to the 'ally of an ally' effect. \([Li et al, 2017, p. 8](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/3/3/e1601895.full.pdf)\).
1.6.1.2.4. Con: Alliance structures reduce [the probability of conflict within blocs](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3877821.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Abab5b72e72085406cb6d489c5386bb13) by correcting informational asymmetries, creating interdependence through trade and allowing individual states to benefit from collective bargaining power.
1.6.1.3. Pro: Russia's shift away from the West make [future sanctions less effective](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/defiant-russia-builds-barriers-us-sanctions), as they are less dependent on the West.
1.6.1.3.1. Pro: Russia has increasingly [moved towards other countries in the BRIC bloc](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2015-12-14/not-so-smart-sanctions).
1.6.1.3.1.1. Pro: The Russian Central Bank has announced that it will start negotiations with other BRIC states to [create an alternative to the SWIFT payment system](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2015-12-14/not-so-smart-sanctions).
1.6.1.3.1.2. Pro: Russia also supported the establishment of the [New Development Bank, a BRIC bank,](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2015-12-14/not-so-smart-sanctions) to replicate the World Bank and IMF.
1.6.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.7.1.
1.6.2. Pro: Historically, sanctions have backfired by making target countries more aggressive. This may happen with Russia as well.
1.6.2.1. Pro: US sanctions against Japan in 1940 drove the Japanese to attack [Pearl Harbour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor).
1.6.3. Con: Russia cannot afford to sanction or make war against the West given its heavy dependence on them purchasing its gas and oil. \([Gould-Davies, 8](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/15832/bpb0818.pdf?sequence=1)\)
1.6.3.1. Pro: Russia is even more dependent on [oil exports](https://jamestown.org/program/russia-more-dependent-on-raw-materials-exports-now-than-in-2008/) now than it was in 2008.
1.6.4. Con: Full reconciliation would require Russia to stop engaging in activities which escalate tensions with the West, something they are not willing to do.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Russia has been given the opportunity of a [relations reset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_reset) with the US before. It resulted only in emboldened Russian aggression. There is no reason to think the same will not happen again.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: The relations reset achieved significant diplomatic milestones, including the signing of the [New START Treaty](https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-02-05-start-treaty_N.htm) to reduce nuclear arms stockpiles and the [sanctions regime put in place against Iran](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/world/19sanctions.html).
1.6.5. Pro: Sanctions reduce economic interdependence between Russia and the West. Economic interdependence is important leverage for reducing Russian aggression.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Economic interdependence is a strong deterrent to war. As sanctions reduce economic interdependence, the possible cost of war between Russia and the West is decreased, making the outbreak of war more likely.
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.10.
1.6.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.3.
1.6.5.3. Con: This is paradoxical: leverage exists so that it can be used to force Russia to change, but using it makes Russia less likely to change, so we should not use the leverage that exists. That renders any leverage the US or the EU may have pointless, and is an argument for doing nothing.
1.6.6. Con: -> See 1.6.4.1.
1.7. Con: Lifting sanctions on Russia would embolden it to behave even more brazenly in pursuit of its own interests.
1.7.1. Pro: The [weak response](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/31/georgia-russia-europe) to Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008 has contributed to Russia's [continued occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/georgia-accuses-russia-of-violating-international-law-over-south-ossetia) in flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement signed between the two countries.
1.7.2. Pro: Lifting sanctions five years after imposing them would signal to Russia that the EU and US are unwilling or unable to do anything about Russian misbehaviour.
1.7.2.1. Pro: The United States' lifting of sanctions on Oleg Deripaska, a Putin ally, in January 2019 has been seen as emboldening Russia by [regional experts](https://www.rferl.org/a/nuland-senate-russia-election-meddling/29307251.html).
1.7.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.
1.7.2.3. Con: Lifting sanctions in exchange for Russia's implementation of the Minsk agreement might incentivise Russia to follow through, as it did for [Iran with the JCPOA](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/understanding-iran-deal-coming-180509072633096.html).
1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.
1.7.4. Pro: Russia's actions have directly threatened democratic systems in the West including direct interference in the [2016 US Presidential Election](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf); the US and EU must sustain the sanction regime in self-defence.
1.7.5. Con: The Russian Government already has large domestic support for its foreign policy despite the implementation of sanctions. Lifting sanctions won't make a difference as Russia will simply continue to carry out its foreign policy as it is doing so currently.
1.7.5.1. Con: An [increasing number](https://www.levada.ru/2018/05/14/rossiya-zapad-2/) of the population in Russia are in favour of strengthening ties with western countries.
1.7.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.
1.7.5.3. Con: Support for Vladimir Putin is at its [lowest level](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/poll-shows-russia-trust-putin-falls-time-190122184309853.html) since 2006 due to lack of faith in his foreign policy.
1.7.5.4. Pro: [93%](https://wciom.com/index.php?id=61&uid=937) of Russians supported the annexation of Crimea.
1.7.5.5. Pro: Putin's approval rating has ranged from [80-90%](http://theconversation.com/why-russians-support-putins-foreign-policy-64353) since the annexation of Crimea.
1.7.5.6. Con: Support for Russia's foreign policy is [falling](https://themoscowtimes.com/news/popular-support-for-putins-foreign-policy-is-dropping-62482) due to increased support by voters to fix domestic issues.
