1.2.1.3.5. Con: This cannot be said for all men. There are many men in history, like [Fredrick Douglas](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/06/a-short-history-of-male-feminism/372673/) that fought for the rights of women.
1.2.1.3.5.1. Pro: [John Stuart Mill](https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/womenvote/parliamentary-collections/1866-suffrage-petition/john-stuart-mill/) published 'The Subjection of Women' in 1866 in regards to equality of the sexes.
1.2.1.4. Pro: Men spend more of their time engaging in pointless oneupmanship, which accounts for many things that men consider achievements.

1.2.2.2.1. Con: Women have [historically](https://www.aauw.org/research/barriers-and-bias/) been discriminated against in corporate fields. Their lack of contribution is plausibly due to the lack of equal opportunity to do so.
1.2.3. Con: The recording of achievements have historically been done by men, leaving women out of many accounts.
1.2.3.1. Con: This indicates that men have been more assertive than women in recording their achievements.

1.3.2. Con: Men are [not more competitive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9639863) than women, but rather what they feel competitive about differs, and thus cannot be compared.

1.5. Pro: Men are more [violent](https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/violence-against-women-1959171-Feb2015/) than women.
1.5.1. Pro: Men, in all societies, initiate the majority of the violence that is legitimized by the body public or by the state.

1.5.6. Con: Men often [under-report violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_men#Female_violence_against_men) experienced from women, due to societal expectations of masculinity.
1.6. Con: There is no better gender; both genders strive in certain areas.
1.7. Con: A generalized statement about a gender will never be accurate, as individuals will always have more variation and difference than similarities to the group.
1.8. Con: To state that women are better than men is to reduce women to stereotypes typically associated with a motherly role.

1.9.1. Con: This is inverse when considering flexibility of the body.
1.9.2. Pro: Due to puberty, men tend to develop [greater bone density and muscle mass](https://unsplash.com/photos/Ga6z9QD8yvw). This helps in many tasks requiring strength and/or endurance.

1.16.5. Con: The gender education gap may be caused by societal issues rather than differences in academic potential.
1.16.5.1. Pro: Research suggests childhood disadvantage is [more harmful](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/images/gender_paper.pdf) to boys than girls.
1.16.5.2. Pro: A [2015 paper](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/publications/docs/workingpapers/2015/IPR-WP-15-16.pdf) found boys are more sensitive to negative environments, such as poverty and stress, than girls.
1.16.5.3. Con: Being better equipped to deal with societal issues implies that women are better than men.
1.16.6. Con: The statistics in the Pro's show a slightly more than even percentage rather than a "significant" one. Also those statistics are only for a single year or two and give no context in terms of population etc \(maybe there were simply more Women than men etc\).
1.17. Con: Women's fertility and ability to produce healthy offspring start declining at a much earlier age.
1.17.1. Pro: Male sperm quality does not begin to significantly decline [until their 60s](https://www.reproductivefacts.org/news-and-publications/patient-fact-sheets-and-booklets/documents/fact-sheets-and-info-booklets/age-and-fertility/).
1.17.2. Pro: Women go through [menopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause) in their 40s and 50s, which among other things lowers and in the end eliminates ends their fertility.

1.18.1. Con: Women's [weightlifting records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Olympic_records_in_weightlifting) are substantially inferior to men's.
1.18.2. Con: Any physical achievement that amounts to doing something a man did first might make the case that women are as good as men \(if that was in dispute, and if physical ability equated to goodness\), but cannot support the position that women are better than men.
1.18.3. Con: If both genders tackled the hardest physical achievements, that would thus mean women are equal to men, and not better.
