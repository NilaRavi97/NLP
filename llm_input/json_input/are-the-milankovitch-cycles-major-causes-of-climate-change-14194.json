Over the course of a solar cycle, the Sun has a small influence on the climate and over 100s millions of years, the gradual warming of the Sun, has a larger influence. However, over the last million years the Sun has had little or no influence. The Milankovitch cycle then man-made CO2 are the major cause of climate change."
