People who do immoral things aren't immoral. The perception of someone as continually and irreversibly immoral precludes the possibility of their change past a certain point life. People have the capacity and will to change after doing bad deeds. Friends and family are likely to pressurize the person to change their behavior. Even if they have the capacity, there is no true way to tell if they have the desire to change, especially if they believe what they did was right. One's sense of morals and ethics develops with age, so it is foolish to brand a person immoral based on one stage of their life. Once one does an immoral thing their continuing existence does not guarantee more immoral acts. Morality is subjective. Thus, if specific actions could be labeled "immoral", individuals (or objects) cannot be labeled "immoral" because it will be very difficult to measure when a person (or an object) becomes "immoral". Morality arguably is objective. People feel guilty and regretful after doing bad deeds. Some do not, and as such, it may be necessary to brand such people immoral. It does not guarantee, but it increases the likelihood, as they have demonstrated that they are not operating under the same moral code as society around them. If you commit a crime, you''re a criminal. If you commit an immoral act, you are, by definition, an immoral person. This is a case of semantics; a criminal can be reformed, an immoral person thus can also be. It is not a lifelong state. Believing that people are immoral leads to tons of anger, shame, violence, and suicide Populations that are deemed immoral commit suicide at a higher rate than other non-stigmatized populations. People cut off ties with their friends if they consider their friends to be immoral. Losing friends is likely to exacerbate their mental health problems. This is the appealing to consequences of belief fallacy. The outcome of a particular belief neither supports or negates the belief itself. The outcome of a particular belief, e.g the proven existence of a deity,  would support the belief itself, e.g the belief in said deity People who do bad things ought to be locked up in jail Not all bad things deserve punishment by imprisonment There is no reliable way to connect imprisonment with the permanent status of immorality. Correctional facilities are designed in some part to rehabilitate prisoners, rather than merely isolate them. Criminals are likely to act again. Different crimes have different recidivism rates, and many have relatively low rates. In many places, the recidivism rate is over 50% (if not substantially higher). People are able to control themselves. People who are unable to stop themselves from doing bad things must be immoral. People who are unable to stop themselves from doing bad things are unable to choose right from wrong, so they can't be immoral. If they cannot tell right from wrong, this is by definition immorality. It's merely insanity. A key feature of an immoral act is the will to commit such an act. People do bad things out of ignorance. Ignorance is not a valid excuse when making moral decisions. Children are imparted with morals from childhood, so ignorance is a poor excuse for moral deficits. This is not something that can be definitively proven; somebody immoral may lie and feign ignorance. People do bad things out of difficulty in doing good things. This doesn't make the situation any better; difficulty performing good things may be true, but that doesn't excuse immoral behaviour. The definition of Immoral means people who are not meeting societies standards of morality. If you are immoral you have committed immoral action(s) by definition.
