Are public speakers that promote self-help making a difference, or just enriching themselves? The difference these speakers make is to motivate people to help themselves. The benefits then come from self-help that follows that motivation. If they were able to produce the claims advertised everyone would be involved in a program. “Self-Help” experts can make ungodly amounts of money. So there is a huge incentive to stay relivent and less to be self-critical about the information being said. People would not be paying thousands of dollars and attending multiple conferences if they weren’t seeing an improvement attributed to the self-help expert. It might also be a placebo. People might feel more self-confident and be more successful, only because they have the impression that they have been helped. People are free to spend their money how they so choose. No one is forcing them to sign up for these programs or attend their speeches. People are often at very low points in their lives when seeking this type of material. If people have advertised something falsely or are making claims to good to be true, desperate people might be tricked into losing money. Their advice is often vague. Offering no real plan of action or program that will map out their journey to success. It’s often just catch phrases and lingo and get you excited but produce no results. Their success is personal. Therefore hard to duplicate the results as everyone has different skill sets and ambitions. There are people that have been in the industry for decades. If they were frads, the government would have shut them down or fined them for misleading the public.
