All cars should be run at very high revs (at the upper limit) sometimes to prevent carbon build up driving fast is life-threatening Nearly 1.3 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. Very high rpms produce high temperatures which burns off built up carbon Driving at very high revs can damage your car Carbon buildup is not a problem in modern cars If this was true, car manufacturers would recommend it in the manual There are mich better methods, this one only makes a slight difference and isn't worth the trouble Many mechanics recommend it It works just as well at 3000 rpm The user manual for my VW Passat 2.0 TDI diesel recommends regularly driving at between 2000-3500rpm for extended periods to help the DPF burn off carbon build up. This does not apply to diesel engines It does apply to diesel engines with DPF because the higher exhaust gas temperatures help to burn off the soot caught in the DPF
