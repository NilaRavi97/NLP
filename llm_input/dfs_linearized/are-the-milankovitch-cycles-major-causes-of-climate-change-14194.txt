The Milankovitch Cycles are major causes of climate change. The variations of Milankovitch cycles aren't large enough to explain the recent spike in global temperature. Satellites have been monitoring the Sun since the 1970s — when the fastest warming has been taking place — and the brightening isn't there. Anthropogenic climate change is much faster. We warm the Earth in 100 years as it naturally happens in 41000 years. Several reports suggest that manmade warming could even accelerate in the next 10 years. The sun is the major influence on climate. The discussion is about climate change and the Sun's influence on climate change depends on the time frame. Over the course of a solar cycle, the Sun has a small influence on the climate and over 100s millions of years, the gradual warming of the Sun, has a larger influence. However, over the last million years the Sun has had little or no influence. The Milankovitch cycle then man-made CO2 are the major cause of climate change. You introduce the Cycles as a poorly understood contributor (which I agree with) to claiming they are the primary cause (which I don't agree with). Poor consistency in your submission. The cycles change over thousands of years. It is recognised that the cycles caused the present Quaternary ice age to start. Geologically we are on the way into a new ice age but temperatures are increasing; so are taking the opposite direction. Milankovitch cycles are insufficient to explain the full range of Quaternary climate change. Other factors caused the Quaternary to begin. It is unclear what other factors this refers to, which makes it too vague to stand. For the past 800 thousand years the Earth has moved from glacial to inter-glacial periods consistently in line with the periods of the Milankovitch cycles. The correlation is not precise and could be coincidence. It should be proved by scientific evidence Not everything can be proved by science. The present way of measuring the changes in the sun's radiative output, Total solar Irradiance (TSI), is overly simplified and not a reliable guide. This does not prove that it is the milankovitch cycles causing climate change. TSI is the best measurement we currently have. It is unclear what TSI stands for - could it be clarified?
