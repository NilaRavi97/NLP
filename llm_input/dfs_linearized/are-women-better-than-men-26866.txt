Women are better than men. Men are more rational than women. This has been shown to be false; ovulating women are as rational as men. The most influential philosophers throughout history have been men. Men have historically had more leisure time for intellectual pursuits than women, due to women being saddled with the bulk of the domestic work. Men are better equipped to work in STEM fields than women. Men perform better in spatial visualization than women, which is an essential skill in STEM fields (pp. 1). Men have achieved more than women in history. Men's greater historical achievements are likely due to factors that have little to do with inherent talent or moral qualities. Some of men's "achievements" (e.g. conquests) have consisted of acts of violence which should not be considered virtuous. Men in many societies have directly prevented women from achieving ambitions beyond the home. Women were only granted the right to vote in the late 19th early 20th century in Europe. The canton Appenzell was forced by a court judgement in 1991 to grant women the right to vote. Women in the US were granted the right to vote in 1920. While men had access to education for millenia, women only got broad access in the modern age. This cannot be said for all men. There are many men in history, like Fredrick Douglas that fought for the rights of women. John Stuart Mill published 'The Subjection of Women' in 1866 in regards to equality of the sexes. Men spend more of their time engaging in pointless oneupmanship, which accounts for many things that men consider achievements. This is not true for all men. There are many historical achievements made by men that rely on inherent talents and moral qualities. Many Black American men and women are noted for historical achievements that required talent or a moral compass to complete. More men than women contributed to building the world. Only 1 woman is in the Forbes 100 Innovators list. Only one woman was recognized by Forbes. This does not mean only one has contributed. 8% of women are in the top 100 Fortune companies. Women have historically been discriminated against in corporate fields. Their lack of contribution is plausibly due to the lack of equal opportunity to do so. The recording of achievements have historically been done by men, leaving women out of many accounts. This indicates that men have been more assertive than women in recording their achievements. Most noted conquerors, like Christopher Columbus, have been men. Men are more competitive than women. Whilst competitiveness can be channelled in productive ways, it is not inherently a virtue. Competition has led to many of humankind's greatest accomplishments. The Apollo 11 Moon landing was a result of competition fueled by the Cold War. Men are not more competitive than women, but rather what they feel competitive about differs, and thus cannot be compared. Men are more interested in competitive sports than women (pg.1). There is larger disproportion of men represented when compared to women at the highest levels for sports/games where physical attributes do not come into play. Examples include any e-sports, chess, scrabble, go etc. Men take leadership roles more often than women. Leadership does not equate to better. There are supportive roles that are necessary to help the leader do their job. Many hospitals would not function without nurses, of which women make up the majority. Men are granted more opportunities to take leadership roles than women. Men often take leadership roles by being ruthless and aggressive, which are not virtuous qualities. A reasonable amount of aggression is a virtuous quality in many leadership contexts, from business to the military. Many women are overlooked for leadership positions. Women, more than men, question if they truly deserve and can excel in leadership roles. This often influences the lack of action in taking them. Men are more violent than women. Men, in all societies, initiate the majority of the violence that is legitimized by the body public or by the state. Between 1480 and 1913 Europe's women queens were 27% more likely to start wars than kings ( www.nber.org ) Men, in all societies, commit the overwhelming majority of sexual violence. Men, in all societies, commit the great majority of violent crime. In the US, men more than double the amount of women in murder, manslaughter, and rape. Women may be less physically violent but they use more emotional and mental abuse instead. Girls/women bully others in a more subtle way then men - they use less physical violence and more social aggression/alienation. psychbc.com Many women are violent in their relationships, however this fact has not gotten a lot of attention historically. Men often under-report violence experienced from women, due to societal expectations of masculinity. There is no better gender; both genders strive in certain areas. A generalized statement about a gender will never be accurate, as individuals will always have more variation and difference than similarities to the group. To state that women are better than men is to reduce women to stereotypes typically associated with a motherly role. Men are generally more physically capable than women. This is inverse when considering flexibility of the body. Due to puberty, men tend to develop greater bone density and muscle mass. This helps in many tasks requiring strength and/or endurance. The greater physical capabilities of men is a large contributing factor as to the degree of male on female crime. The greater physical abilities have led to greater levels of seriousness of injury when men act violently. Physical capability is not a moral quality. Women are better at empathy than men. More women are vegetarian but more men are vegan, so men are slightly more ethical than women. The ethics of an individual is not based solely on their food choices. Empathy does not necessarily imply superiority. Empathy sure is one of the most important abilities a human being can develop. A study suggests that female adolescents display more cognitive and emotional empathy than male adolescents. There is no objective scale of goodness. There are objective scales in a lot of different factors, which can contribute to the understanding of whether one gender is better than another. The perception and definition of "good" depends on the social, religious, and ethnic context. There are many different personal qualities and skills - such as reliability and kindness, cooking and listening - which one cannot sum up like an equation. Comparing genders without defining a specific role / function that one gender should be better at, is very hard. Men are more reckless and foolhardy than women. Men are likely to be homeless and do drugs than women. When men and women took the same action, men were rated as being more risky, indicating a bias in thinking. Taking risks in itself should not be seen as a negative, only risk without thought. If appropriate risk-management/minimisation is taken, prospective gains can heavily outweigh cost. Men often are more risky with driving than women. Men take less responsibility for their sexual activity than women. Women live with the consequences of pregnancy longer than men do, so they take more responsibility for their actions. Women commit dramatically less serious crime Women live longer than men. In the US the life expectancy gender gap is 6.7 years. This doesn't mean they're better; just hardier. A longer life expectancy may indicate a more responsible lifestyle. Women tend to make healthier food choices than men. Men take more life-threatening risks than women. Men are historically more likely to take jobs that put their lives at risk than women. The Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries listed 4,761 male deaths in comparison to 386 female deaths related to occupation. Significantly more women than men are graduating from high schools and universities. Of the graduation year 2020-21, 53.6% of those receiving a doctorate in the US will be female. Of the graduation year 2020-21, 61.9% of those receiving a Masters in the US will be female. In 2016, 57.0%.png) of all graduates in the European Union of a Master (or equivalent) degree, were women. In 2016, 61% of all graduates in the EU of post-secondary non-tertiary programs were female. The gender education gap may be caused by societal issues rather than differences in academic potential. Research suggests childhood disadvantage is more harmful to boys than girls. A 2015 paper found boys are more sensitive to negative environments, such as poverty and stress, than girls. Being better equipped to deal with societal issues implies that women are better than men. The statistics in the Pro's show a slightly more than even percentage rather than a "significant" one. Also those statistics are only for a single year or two and give no context in terms of population etc (maybe there were simply more Women than men etc). Women's fertility and ability to produce healthy offspring start declining at a much earlier age. Male sperm quality does not begin to significantly decline until their 60s. Women go through menopause in their 40s and 50s, which among other things lowers and in the end eliminates ends their fertility. Women might not be able to conceive naturally, but they can still have kids via in vitro fertilization. The risk of having a miscarriage dramatically increases for women in their 30s. Women have tackled the hardest physical achievements, just like men. Women's weightlifting records are substantially inferior to men's. Any physical achievement that amounts to doing something a man did first might make the case that women are as good as men (if that was in dispute, and if physical ability equated to goodness), but cannot support the position that women are better than men. If both genders tackled the hardest physical achievements, that would thus mean women are equal to men, and not better. Women sometimes beat men in extreme endurance races. Women have been to space, Mount Everest, the North and South Pole and complete the hardest sport events.
