Agile certifications do not advance Agile thinking Certifications can be a way for those who are new to Agile to quickly cover a lot of ground. Following a set curriculum makes it easy to know where to start and what core material need to be covered. Certifications support and are built on current ways of thinking. Certification programs exist to make money for the training companies, not to encourage new thinking. There is no evidence that can prove this is the only motivation for training companies. Certifications force people to think deeply about the material, which can lead to new ideas along the way. Certifications are usually obtained through learning, not through thinking. Quite the opposite: 'thinking' may lead to 'wrong' answers in the final exams. Certifications force people to read and reflect a lot to be able elaborate their own positions. This certainly benefits thinking. Certifications are not difficult to obtain. That depends on the certification and the person's existing capacity and knowledge. Many certifications are designed in a way that (just) require learning as opposed to understanding. Certifications prove you are serious about your craft and willing to take the time to learn and improve. This may be useful as a sign to employers, but does not necessarily advance the skill. While Certifications are a sign that someone has taken some time to learn, they don't necessarily denote seriousness about a craft. There may be many other motivations to obtain such sign. Certifications lock you into one way of thinking/methodology (Scrum, Kanban, etc) and not how Agile applies across multiple methodologies. Experience counts for way more than training. Agile is a practice, it's a practical approach to building software. As such, it is only through practical application that such a practice can be mastered. Even if this is true, that does not prove that certifications don't advance agile thinking, just that they are not the most effective way of doing so. It is impossible to get experience without first understanding some basics. Some certifications require practical experience, even if within the context of the certification. Certifications reward those who are good at taking tests.
