All our actions are selfish to some degree. Selfishness is a human survival instinct . According to the definition, a selfish person only cares about what they want or need without any thought for the needs or wishes of other people. If people help others out, then they are thinking about the needs of others By saying 'all actions are selfish to some degree', the debate allows for situations where a person has multiple motivations. But if part of the motivation is about the individual actor, then this can allow someone to do a selfless action and it still be motivated partially through their own self interests. When someone saves a life during a shift as a lifeguard, they may be genuinely worried about the person drowning, but the fact that their job and career relies on them doing a good job means that there is also a selfish aspect to their motivations. When somebody gives their life for someone, they can't gain anything from it hence it's a completely selfless act. If they don't give their life they might be tortured by their conscience hence by giving it they prevent themselves from feeling pain in future. People serving in the military consent to lay down their lives. However, they do it for financial gains. People join the military because of nationalistic sentiments. They are willing to give up their lives for fellow citizens. Islamic terrorists engage in suicide bombing because they are promised heaven in the afterlife. They may value the idea of their legacy more. Sacrificing themselves so that they would be remembered a hero/martyr etc. Self sacrifice can be egotistical. Parents sacrifice their lives for their children. Evolution requires parents to protect their children as children are the only way of passing on one's genes. A person who does not protect their children risks losing their contribution to the gene pool. Therefore, protecting your children is ultimately a selfish act. Parents put the happiness of their children before their own. Parents do not like to see their children sad. By ensuring your child's happiness, you are increasing your own happiness, or at least preventing yourself heartache. There are very few instances where a person sacrificing their life could not equally prove themselves to be a hero in later life if they chose to survive. They lose all control over their future and their image in death. Choosing to end their own life so that another can have those future years and opportunities instead is incompatible with selfishness. Lots of people engage in self destructive behavior that has nothing but bad consequences for them. Self-destructive behavior is usually considered a symptom of other underlying psychological issues. A person does not meaningfully control their actions, thus self destructive behaviour cannot be considered either selfish or unselfish. One of the contributing factors to self-destructive behaviors is selfishness, in which a person becomes consumed by how they feel and nothing else. People do selfless deeds for others. Even though some people tend to do good deeds for others, they are never completely selfless and benefits them in some way or prevents them from some harm. Giving money to the poor comes at the detriment of people. When we give someone a gift or give it to a charity we benefit because we either feel good or think that God will reward us sometime The Islamic tradition instructs its followers to treat neighbors well. Many atheists give charity as well. A study has revealed that Muslims and Christians are less generous than atheists. A poll in the UK finds that Muslims give more charity than others. Even if there's no tangible benefit from the "selfless" deed, people will still feel better about themselves or some degree of pleasure, which is the true motivation for their actions. Self preservation is the most basic human instinct. Our actions are done with the intent to protect ourselves. The evolution of cultural 'memes' have the potential to override the instincts bred by natural evolution. Humans are products of evolution and evolutionarily humans are genetically programmed to save themselves only. The instinct for self-preservation has a biological basis in human evolution. The instinct for self-preservation can manifest in modern society through emotional impulses such as greed. Evolutionarily "saving the genes" is the ultimate goal, hence parents can be completely selfless for their kids Altruism has more of an evolutionary advantage than selfishness does. Groups with higher numbers of ‘altruists’ are better able to survive the random catastrophic events that happen from time to time because they can rely on each other to get through them. It has been shown mathematically that “altruistic behaviour is favoured by chance when the benefits of cheating are sufficiently small compared to a, how well the population would do without any cheats, and b, the typical size of random fluctuations in the population”. Freud believed that self preservation lay at the core of human nature. Our only way of thinking about the world is through perception, inextricably linked with our sense of self. This colours all actions with a degree of selfishness. This assumes that one has a high opinion of the self. If one assumes the self to be lower in status than that of others' selves, then one is likely to perceive all situations selflessly. Choices/ actions that are based on morality (charity, 'good deeds') are usually ultimately about what kind of person we wish to be, or to be perceived as being. Many people give charity because they want to show off and be seen as charitable by others. Sacrificial decisions for the sake of friends or family are usually ultimately about protecting someone we love because they are important to us. Actions based on religious beliefs are ultimately about ensuring our own place in an afterlife, or about securing the love or acceptance of a deity, thus making the motivation based on self-interest. Even though we experience the world through perception, we are also capable of rational thought and empathy. Therefore, we can override the selfishness of our actions arising from these perceptions. Some people do good deeds because, it's embedded in their culture and religion. Some religions completely give up the idea of self. Buddhism completely gives up the idea of the self. Giving up the self is an act of self-improvement for a persons own benefit. The goal for all Buddhists is nirvana), which is achieved by giving up the idea of Self. In these religions, the reward is enlightenment, reincarnation, or similar. Arguably, being selfless thus serves a beneficial outcome in the future, and is therefore selfish. According to the Biblical canon, the reward for good deeds is entry into Heaven. According to the Quranic tradition, those who do more good deeds than bad shall enter Jannah, or Paradise. In many major religions, such as Islam, intention plays an important role in deliberating whether an action is moral or immoral. Those who perform good deeds for selfish reasons are unlikely to be rewarded for them. This logically leads to benefit to ones self. If you do a good deed for selfish reasons, you're doing a selfish act. If you do an action without selfish reasons, by your logic the incentive would be the chase of reward, which is an oxymoron in itself. According to studies, cooperation is also contagious. Groups and societies tend to non-selfish behaviour simply because they are accustomed to it. Researchers at Harvard University analyzed data from previous experiments that had used public-goods game and found that cooperation is contagious. In cultures and religions where good deeds are the norm, people are likely to conform in order to escape punishment or social persecution. This is still a selfish motivation. For those born - or socialised - into these societies, it is likely that they have internalized the cultural norms and values of the society. In this situation, they are unlikely to want to rebel from society in the first place. Animals have been shown to punish other members of their species that display amoral behaviour. In Plato's "Republic," Socrates has a discussion with his older brother Glaucon in which Glaucon insists that people's good behavior actually only exists for self-interest: People only do the right thing because they fear being punished if they get caught. Human thought starts out well, but when it sees no option in real life to make their positive thoughts actionable, they resort to negative behaviors, of which some are selfish.
