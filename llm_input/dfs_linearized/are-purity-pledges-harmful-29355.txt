Purity pledges are harmful. Purity pledges are part of a culture that contributes to a variety of harmful stereotypes. In the face of rampant hypersexualization, chastity is a way to rebel against stereotypes about gender and sexuality. Pledgers provide a support network for people who are trying to turn away from societal and cultural pressures to have sex and engage in sexual activities at a young age. Men find support groups to be a caring, supportive, and safe space where they are able to have open and frank conversations about sexual desire. They view their ability to remain abstinent as a sign of masculinity and a way to assert themselves. Staying pure allows women to take control of their sexuality and not conform to the expectations of society. Taking control of their sexuality means that woman have a choice to do what they want. Many commit to purity pledges in their early teens, with some pledgers being as young as 10. Rather than giving them control, pledges rob women of their choice at an age where they don't even understand fully what they are promising to do. Educating women to know that they do not have to conform to expectations and pressures to have sex provides them with much more control over their sexuality. A culture of casual sex can have negative impacts on young people's health. Casual sex is linked to experiencing feelings of shame, regret, and depression. Studies report that nearly half of all women feel negatively about their previous hook-ups. Researchers examining the mental health associations of hookup sex report that participants who were not depressed before showed more depressive symptoms and loneliness after engaging in casual sex. A culture of casual sex can make people feel pressured into needing to have sex because everyone else is doing it, leading to feelings of regret later down the line. The feelings of shame and guilt that accompany casual sex for many people may be linked back to the idea ingrained in us by religion that sex is something to be ashamed of. Far from protecting people from the harms of casual sex, concepts such as purity pledges reinforce the worst aspects of it. Purity culture ties a woman's self-worth to her virginity, encouraging the idea that a sexually impure woman has nothing to offer to the world. Pledgers often struggle, both before and after marriage, with feeling a lack of ownership over their bodies. Virginity can become such a central part of an individual's identity that after having sex they do not understand their identity or role within their community, leaving them with feelings of helplessness and self-doubt. As abstinence is the only totally effective birth control, and teen mothers are seen as having damaged their futures in the view of all parts of society, purity culture seems to be making a valid point about the cultural risks of sex. A study by Card has found that with controls for background variables, adolescent child-bearers earned less than later child-bearers or those childless at all. Feelings of shame or guilt are attached to all forms of sexuality, regardless of the presence of religion. Culture has been known to strongly influence sexual attitudes. A study on cultural influences on the sexual attitudes of young Latina adolescents determined the influence was significant enough to be used to potentially address the problem of unprotected sex. Creating feelings of guilt and shame was how church leaders ensured young people would stick to their pledges. Even for those who eventually left the movement, these feelings remained. Purity pledges can place a double burden on victims of sexual harassment and violence. Analysis of the language used by families who support purity pledges show that it sends a message that women have no sexual agency. Purity pledges, like other religious vows of celibacy, do not require the pledge to be a virgin. When pledgers are told that women must behave and dress in such a way so as to control men's desires, if a non-consensual interaction takes place it puts the blame on the woman for not preventing it. Elizabeth Smart, a survivor of kidnap and assault, has spoken about how distressing she found the idea that she was "impure" after her assault. She understood why a woman would not even try to escape her kidnappers after assault - at that point they would be considered worthless by their communities. Shame is a nearly universal reaction to molestation and sexual assault, regardless of gender, religion or culture. Purity culture adds an extra layer of shame for victims of sexual assault. Many purity culture teachings hold women directly responsible for managing the sexual behaviour of the men around them. Women are told to dress and behave modestly so as not to tempt men. Individuals do have a sole responsibility to give or withhold consent. Some Evangelicals preach that men are more likely to be led astray because of "their hormones and their nature", and so the women around them are "responsible for their own purity and for helping young men remain pure". This may be an accurate assessment of average teenage behavior, regardless of ideology. During a purity ball sponsored by the police, one of the police officers told the women present that pre-marital sex would inevitably lead to sexual assault, gangs, drugs and prostitution. Someone else said that wasn't true, disagreeing with the police officer. Rape is framed as boys "losing control" of their natural instincts, as opposed to committing a crime (Fahs, 121). Purity pledges encourage women to adopt the worldview that women are distinct and essentially different from men and that sexuality is in itself dangerous, resulting in the construction of sexual violence as “giving in” to temptation (Fahs, 117) There is no distinction between the sin of violence and the sin of desire. Victims of abuse are encouraged to forgive their abusers in language that equates the assault to consensual sex within the interactive sections of True Love Waits (Fahs, 122). Most religions encourage forgiveness in all aspects of life, not just for rapists. Forgiveness has been found to be emotionally healthy, especially in the long term. True Love Waits is not the definitive source for all information on attitudes within Purity Culture, but a single perspective that can't speak for everyone. Victims of pedophilia are less likely to come forward and ask for help when they are raised by families that promote purity. Purity pledges give people a viable alternative to this culture, and can educate them about the benefits of choosing a different path. Taking a pledge is not education. Pledges remain in normal society, surrounded by alternate viewpoints and educational materials. Many people, including mental health professionals, claim that breakups between two people who have had sex are more emotionally traumatic than those between people who have not had sex. There is scientific and anecdotal evidence that casual sex can be good for people's mental and physical well-being. Sex releases a number of hormones that are anti-aging, immunity-boosting, and can help protect individuals against diseases. Sex is a natural pain reliever. Sex releases hormones which can boost self esteem and a person's general mood. These benefits can also be attained by having an active sex life when married. Married couples are likely to have more sex than people looking for casual hookups since they don't have to find new partners all the time. Statistics show that married couples have less sex after they are married than before. 52% of married people wish they had more sex. It is possible to have a consistent sexual partner without being married to them. Most married couples do not have as active a sex life. Cohabitating couples report having more sex than married couples. Casual sex is claimed to increase confidence, sexual pleasure, and can make individuals feel desirable. It is not an era of 'hyper-sexualisation' but rather a continuation of the sexual revolution which has been a positive cultural shift. Sex positivity is important for placing an emphasis on pleasurable sexual activity and consent. It is argued that purity culture is simply the latest in a series of U.S. purity campaigns that have typically been prompted by the white Protestant fear of national decline that presented the (white, heterosexual) American family as a stabilizing force. These stigmas can lead to pledgers suffering from psychological issues. A pledger reported being so traumatized when she kissed a man that she broke up with him for fear she would ruin her life. This anecdote is not typical nor does it demonstrate the clinical cause of the trauma. Pledgers described feelings of humiliation, shame, and disgust toward their bodies and sexual identities. Pledgers and other religious women report having unhappy - and sometimes even traumatic - relationships with their body and sexuality after being taught that premarital sex was a sin. Ex-pledgers can find it hard to fully understand and enjoy their sexuality owing to persistent anxiety and shame. After being told for so long that sex was immoral, dirty and a sin, some women develop a serious fear of sex which prevents them having sex once they are married. Purity pledges are no different than any traditional culture's approach to sexuality and virginity at marriage, and it isn't clear how this exists as a separate issue from a critique of religious conservatism. These programs are largely heteronormative and often stigmatize other sexualities as deviant. Schools which provide abstinence only education have been shown to promote a culture which stigmatises same-sex marriage. Abstinence only education programs promote the stereotype that gay men are promiscuous. There is a dire need for LGBTQ+ issues to be addressed in sex-ed programs. Studies have found that LGBTQ+ teens are more likely to start having sex at an earlier age. The lack of acknowledgement regarding LGBTQ+ communities can create feelings of exclusion and rejection. LGBTQ+ teens may not feel comfortable talking about specific issues if they don't see their teachers addressing their experiences in school, leading them to rely on information from their peers or the internet — which may not be accurate. Schools that teach an abstinence-only sexuality curriculum are creating a uniquely dangerous environment for youth who are LGBTQ or questioning their sexual orientation. LGBT students whose curricula include positive discussion of LGBT people, history, and events hear fewer homophobic remarks and feel safer in school than students without inclusive curricula. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers. Abstinence is not a concept that applies only to heterosexuals. Studies have found that LGBTQ+ teenagers are less likely to use contraception and more likely to contract HIV or other STIs. A study found that bisexual females were five times more likely to become pregnant than their straight peers, and questioning and gay males were four times more likely to report getting someone pregnant. Students who receive sexuality education including refusal skills training before college matriculation are at lower risk of experiencing sexual assault. Providing such training for LGBTQ+ students could help equip them to deal with such situations as well. Studies have found that LGBTQ+ teenagers are more likely to experience sexual violence Sex education that promotes protection from STDs and the importance of consent doesn't address preventing sexual violence from their sexual dating partners. Abstinence does by avoiding the kind of intimate situations that typify date rape and other partner violence. Abstinence-only programs have included refusal skills training - the key element in decreasing risk of sexual assault. There is no philosophical conflict of interest between teaching abstinence and refusal skills. The source quoted makes an unsupported connection between sex ed and refusal training. These concepts are not inseparable, nor is refusal incompatible with abstinence only education. Purity pledges contribute to harmful stigmas about virginity. Purity pledges are a consequence of this stigma, not a cause. Purity pledges reinforce the idea that the value of women is inextricably linked to their virginity. Women are dehumanized as a result of purity culture. Women who have pledged become less likely to admit to having been raped or abused and more likely to stay with their abuser or rapist. They are less likely to admit to being victims of sexual violence because they may be afraid of people thinking they broke their pledge intentionally. Purity pledges reinforce the notion that being a virgin is good, and that not being a virgin renders someone impure. These programs focus on traditional gender roles, such as female passivity and male aggressiveness. Purity pledges can be empowering for women by affording them sexual agency (Hanna, 24). There is a double standard inherent to purity pledges. Things such as purity rings, purity balls, and overprotective parenting are directed at women and are rarely seen with young men (Paul, 6) Purity balls, which go hand-in-hand with purity pledges, exist solely for fathers and daughters. The wording of the pledges at these balls teaches young, uninformed girls that they need a man (their father) to protect their virtue. At Purity balls, similarly, fathers take a vow to protect their daughter’s chastity until they marry. This makes fathers likely to unreasonably restrain the freedom of their daughters from a young age. This means fathers are likely to not allow their daughters to interact with the opposite gender such as to go on dates or make male friends because they feel they are at war for their daughters’ purity. Restraining their freedom means their daughters are less likely to have access to educational opportunities or experiences that require them to be alone such as cultural exchange programs or college away from home. etc. All reasonable parenting involves restraints on child freedom in exchange for security. A parenting culture that seeks to avoid premarital sex is no less rich than one that tends avoids drug experimentation or joining cults. Westerners have considerable alternatives when it comes to experience and education. In a world where sexual violence against women such as rape and sexual assault are rampant, excessive parental control over their children's freedom isn't unreasonable. Many movements claim that Purity balls are a "fatherhood event, not a virginity or abstinence event." Therefore it is not "appropriate to put that weight on the daughter's shoulders." There is no standard for "reasonable freedom" when it comes to childhood access to dating, romance and sex. Most social and legal standards are based on the notion that minors should not be engaged in any sort of sexual congress, and the general public has taken virtually no steps to repeal that enforcement or lower ages of consent. Purity balls are designed as a festive and celebratory events with dance and music which further normalises them, amplifying the harm they cause. Purity balls help make father and daughter relationships stronger. A strong father-daughter relationship is beneficial for all members of the family as it strengthens the unit. Daughters who spend more time with their fathers are more likely to have higher self-esteem, go to college and get better jobs than those who do not. Such practices revive old school patriarchal notions about how women are property that is transferred from father-owner to husband-owner upon marriage. Attention to the father-daughter relationship in the sexual purity movement highlights the ways that sexual purity is primarily about subject formation and the ordering of relationships—in families, in the nation, and in the church. It reinforces the existing hierarchy of relationships. A purity pledger reported that even within her family, she and her sisters were expected to wear purity rings, but they were deemed unnecessary for her brother. She further reported that men who did wear purity rings received more positive responses than women who did within society, because men were seen to be doing something "admirable" while it was simply expected of women. Sexual behavior is different between genders outside of purity culture as well. One abstinence-only curricula teaches that women need “financial support,” while men need “admiration.” Another instructs: “Women gauge their happiness and judge their success on their relationships. Men’s happiness and success hinge on their accomplishments.” (Waxman, ii) True Love Waits argues that women are not motivated by sexual desires, but only by the desire for true love. (Fahs, 121.) Beliefs such as these are likely to lead to women having less sexually satisfying lives even once they are married. Purity culture goes beyond abstinence - it has to be accompanied by a total, whole-person commitment to repressing every aspect of your sexuality and conforming to acceptable standards of sexuality. Individuals taking this pledge are encouraged to keep their minds clear of sexual thoughts, and by doing so they are more likely to ignore many important questions they may have about their body and other sexual functions. Purity pledges are particularly harmful for young people questioning and trying to understand their sexuality. When all sexual actions are considered a sin and abstinence is seen as the only legitimate behaviour by your family and community, young people have no one to turn to with questions about their sexuality. By postponing all questions about their sexuality until marriage, individuals may not understand their sexuality fully until well into adulthood. This means they may have to go through a questioning process when they are already married/have children etc. Purity pledges are ineffective. The majority of pledgers end up having sex before marriage. 12% of teenagers pledge to remain abstinent until marriage. Only 3% are successful in this endeavour. Purity pledges are a wasted investment. Over the past two decades, the United States has spent approximately $2 billion on ineffective and stigmatizing programming for adolescents focused on promoting abstinence from sex outside of marriage. President Bush pushed for more funding for abstinence only programs despite a Congressional study showing they were ineffective. The US ended up spending about $1 billion on failed abstinence-only sex education programs from 1997 to 2007, yet President Bush proposed a 2008 budget of $204 million for such programs. The acceptance of "purity" as an effective directive on a government level has led to the pursuit of questionable policies which in turn has led to the wasting of resources. The US government spent $1.4 billion on abstinence education in Africa as a way to prevent the spread of HIV. This policy measure was a failure. 86% of school districts with a sex ed policy require promotion of abstinence and 51% of districts require that abstinence be taught as the preferred method of birth control. Promotion of abstinence is not, in itself, negative. Special Programs of Regional and National Significance, which is the largest and fastest growing source of abstinence-only education, provides federal grants to community-based organizations that teach abstinence until marriage to youth. In its first year of funding in the fiscal year of 2001, SPRANS recipients received $20 million in grants (Waxman, 1). The continued support of purity pledges despite their ineffectiveness is a sign of incompetence on part of the government. The government's responsibility is to pursue policies that further the best interest of their citizens. Abstinence programs undermine the promotion of other sex-ed programs within schools. Extensive research has shown that comprehensive sex education is inclusive and aims to equip children and young people with the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values that will empower them to make their own decisions. In the US, teenage pregnancies and STDs were on the rise again, after the push by President Bush for abstinence-only sex education program in 2007. A study by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, in 2007, showed that programs that combine abstinence and contraception were mostly ineffective. Six months before this study, another study - by the Guttmacher Institute - of federally funded abstinence-only-until-marriage programmes found that abstinence-only educational programmes had no beneficial impact on young people's sexual behaviour. Another 2007 study, by the Mathematica Policy Research, showed students in abstinence-only programs were not more likely to abstain from sex, delay having sex or have fewer partners than students who received no sex education at all. These harmful effects have subsided since the Obama administration, in 2010, started funding and implementing a comprehensive teen pregnancy prevention programs that focus on boosting academic achievement, extracurricular activities and smarter life decisions rather than the failed abstinence-only sex education programs. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that $155 million in teen pregnancy prevention grants were being awarded to states, non-profit organisations, school districts, universities and others. Researchers found that teenagers who take purity pledges delay intercourse substantially longer than those who do not make such a public commitment to chastity. Christian colleges often advocate for purity pledges to be taken and promote abstinence only education, however this does not help to reduce their sexual assault rates. A lack of knowledge about how to deal with sex, alcohol, partying etc in college beyond "don't do it" leaves students vulnerable to exploitation. If Christian colleges keep sexual assault in the same tabooed category as any and all sex, it can result in a lack of open and frank discussion around boundaries, consent, and rights. Sexual assault is not sex, it is violence. Abstinence is not a pledge against violent, criminal acts but against legal, consensual sex. Even if this is true, if a pledger sexually assaults someone, it can and ought to be counted as the pledge having failed to prevent sexual activity. Christian colleges have less sexual assault than secular campuses. According to a study, making a formal pledge did not appear to have an effect on sexual behavior. Purity pledges were found to be moderately effective only when religious commitment is high. However, for pledge signers with low religious commitment, the likelihood of staying committed is very low. The promotion of abstinence during the Bush era became a platform for many religious groups, and the purity ring became the symbol of the purity commitment. Religious commitment forms a natural part of the motivation of pledgers to stay committed. The effect of purity pledges only extends to sexual intercourse and not other sexual behaviours. A study examining the purity pledge among college students found that although pledgers were less likely to have had sexual intercourse than non-pledgers (66% vs. 78%), they were equally likely to have had oral and anal sex. Studies show that individuals who make a private pledge to themselves are less likely to have sex before marriage. Studies found that making a public pledge as well as a private pledge did not increase the likelihood that an individual would wait until marriage. A private pledge to wait can exist without all the social and familial pressure that public purity pledges involve. The predominant complaint about purity pledges isn't that they are ineffective in making people's lives better, but that they make people who don't want to take or adhere to them feel bad. Purity pledges help Christians in reasserting their commitment to not have sex before marriage. The commitment to not have sex before marriage is important for Christians because pre-marital sex i.e. fornication is a grave sin. Purity pledges are likely to prevent them from committing this sin. There are several verses in the Bible which have been relied on to deem fornication and adultery a sin. There are several verses in the Bible (such as 1 Corinthians 5:1, Galatians 5:19-21, 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5, 1 Corinthians 7:8-9, Genesis 2:24-25, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20. etc.) which state that sexual immorality is a sin. Many therefore have inferred sexual immorality to include fornication. Since fornication is a grave sin, Christians ought to be able to avoid it even without making a formal purity pledge. Since modern society has rejected sin in favor of secular motivations based on freedom, purity pledges seek to counter the heavy messaging favoring casual sex. Since purity pledges force believers to take an undertaking of abstinence and remain pure, they are likely to stay away from lust (which specifically includes other sinful sexual acts in addition to adultery and fornication) -one of the seven deadly sins in Christianity. With a change in sexual norms, it is much more acceptable in society to have sex prior to marriage than it is to commit adultery. Pre-marital sex does not often directly harm someone whereas adultery almost always does. The harm of both pre-marital sex and adultery reside in who has knowledge of them and their attitude toward that knowledge. The actual acts aren't harmful, but both can be perceived negatively by some people. They are not different in effect, just in which people hold negative attitudes about each of them and their relative percentage of the population. Actions taken at a younger age (fornication) are not likely to affect actions taken at a later age (adultery) simply because a person is likely to change and mature as they age. Purity pledges allow like-minded Christians to have a sense of community, by coming together and helping each other reinforce the commitment to not sin. Many religions facilitate 'accountability groups' where people come together and discuss their relationship with God. These groups often encourage a discussion of sin and failings in order to help one another overcome them, and so groups such as these can provide support and information to individuals trying to adhere to a purity pledge. The public nature of purity pledges allows people to gather around them and form said sense of community. For many younger religious people they maintain what is known as 'technical virginity' allowing them to maintain their religious beliefs. From a Christian point of view, any form of sexual activity before marriage is a sin. Seen through this lens, 'technical virginity' as a concept enables sin rather than helping young Christians adhere to their faith. It is unclear why reasserting such a commitment is beneficial, if the commitment of a purity pledge and purity culture is believed to be harmful. It is beneficial because they believe damnation is more harmful than fornication is beneficial. Purity pledges lead to people having a poorer understanding of sexuality. There are a number of effective alternatives to pre-marital sex that allow a person to explore their sexuality and sexual preference. Body exploration or masturbation allows people to gain knowledge about their bodies, get in touch with their sensuality, and increase their comfort level when having sex. This in turn increases their ability to communicate their preferences to their partner. Podcasts can provide insight about sex, answer questions that women may have, and help them discover things about their sexuality. Online classes and workshops are available to help people discover and explore their sexuality. Purity pledges make individuals promise to keep their mind clear of any and all sexual thoughts, as even thinking about sex makes an individual impure. It is unlikely that pledgers who are told and believe this idea would feel comfortable proactively exploring their sexuality. Schools can provide information on sex even if students are not currently engaging in sex. Parents often inform their children about sex when they are below the age of consent. Purity pledges lead to people not having a proper understanding of the potential consequences of sex. A study has demonstrated that purity pledges can increase teenage pregnancy rates. The incidence of pregnancy was 30% for pledgers as compared to 18% for non-pledgers. Purity pledges are a facet of abstinence-only sex education. These programs disseminate false information regarding sex. Abstinence programmes are likely to lead to people engaging in unsafe sex Abstinence programmes also push against increasing access to contraceptives. They have even called the Gardasil vaccine the “whore drug,” because they believe it would give young women the idea that they can go and have promiscuous sex without the repercussions of HPV and ovarian cancer (Paul, 6). This affects pledgers and non-pledgers alike. A study found that pledging does not appear to affect sexual safety among pledgers who fail to remain abstinent. Pledgers are 10% less likely than non-pledgers to use condoms. Pledgers often believe contraceptives are unreliable. Some abstinence groups tell their students condoms have a 30% fail rate (Paul, 4). A report found that 80 percent of the most popular curricula used by federally funded abstinence-only education programs distort information and blur the line between science and religion. Abstinence programs generally promote the idea that contraceptives are ineffective (National Partnership, 2) and even harmful. These programs claim birth control causes cancer (Paul, 4) Some condoms leach nitrosamine, a chemical thought to be carcinogenic and which has not been tested against the mucus membranes of the mouth and genitals. A 2001 study found that the risk of tumors from nitrosamines in condoms was exceedingly low. In fact, the detectable level of nitrosamines in condoms is lower than those found in food, water, and other consumer goods (CEH, 4). None of the curricula provides information on how to select a birth control method and use it effectively (Waxman, 11) These programs misrepresent the risks of abortion. One curriculum states that 5% to 10% of women who have legal abortions will become sterile (Waxman, i) Abortions do lead to a small increase in fertility and pregnancy complications According to the source, the risk of fertility and pregnancy complications in abortions is rare. A rare side-effect has an incidence of less than 0.01% and is thus significantly less than the statistic cited (5-10%) by the curriculum for the risk of sterility. A curriculum states that mental retardation (resulting from premature birth) is increased following the abortion of the first pregnancy. Obstetrics textbooks teach that vacuum aspiration, the method used in most abortions in the United States, does not result in an increase in such risks (Waxman, 13) While vacuum aspiration of the first pregnancy was not found to have lasting effects,. multiple procedures do have an effect on subsequent pregnancies in half the studies. Abstinence-only curricula contain scientific errors. Within an abstinence program, a 43-day-old fetus was referred to as a “thinking person (Waxman, ii). Electrical activity in the developing fetus' brain is found at 43 days. As there is no scientific definition of "thought", a "thinking person" could be defined as any human tissue with its own brain activity. Withholding or distorting medical information is a violation of adolescent human rights. Educators are required to disregard basic ethical standards by providing incomplete and potentially harmful information to students (Santelli, 8600276-4/pdf)). A pledge alone is not a bar on education but a promise not to perform an action. Other groups of people who don't engage in sex (e.g. asexual people) can still have an understanding of sex. Women enter the sexual phase of their lives completely unprepared. This leaves them very vulnerable to being used, manipulated, and abused. A lack of discussion around consent in purity culture can leave pledgers unable to distinguish between consensual and non-consensual interactions. A particular problem for pledge makers and breakers is that of 'cultural lag' - people update their values faster than they update their actions to correspond to those values. This resulted in large numbers of pledgers deciding to have premarital sex, but not deciding to use birth control or condoms. Purity culture has led to several women feeling betrayed by Christianity and turning away from their religion. Christian women can still feel objectified and commodified by purity culture. No source has shown that purity pledges have had a preponderance of negative effects on those that took them and, especially, kept those pledges. A handful of individual anecotes, especially from people that haven't managed to take and maintain their pledges, do not constitute a widespread problem. Abstinence is a life choice that should be made personally and in consistency with one's worldview. If one holds to it of their own convictions there is no harm. Many individuals feel pressured by their church, their parents, or even their peers to remain abstinent. Social pressure can be very positive. It is only bad when it encourages bad behavior. This can only apply to a limited number of cases. Most purity pledgers are children who do not understand what they are committing to. Refraining from sex until marriage leads to happier marriages. Sexual chemistry with your partner can be an important feature of a happy relationship. It can be useful to know whether any exists between you and your partner before committing to marry them. Individuals who waited until marriage can experience regret and even the break up of their relationship if they find they have no sexual chemistry with their partner. Pre-marital sex gives individuals time to explore their sexuality and sexual preferences. This is information they can use if they are choosing a partner to spend their life with. Exploration of their sexuality can have benefits for both heterosexual women and women from sexual minorities. Sexual chemistry can be developed with a partner after marriage. Several blogs and opinion pieces are dedicated to the question of how to develop sexual chemistry after marriage. Studies have found that if an individual has had sexual partners before getting married, that marriage is more likely to end in divorce. The lowest divorce rates were found among people who had 0 or 1 sexual partners before getting married. As suggested in the above linked source, the correlation between abstinence and divorce isn't causal. Both are more likely results of the same social pressures from the religious culture those women already live in. Respondents in a study who waited until marriage to have sex reported higher levels of stability, satisfaction, and communication in their relationship than those who had pre-marital sex. There is no reason why having a sexual aspect to a relationship necessarily means that other aspects are underdeveloped. Furthermore, it is possible to develop skills such as communication and trust within sexual experiences. Higher levels of relationship satisfaction are linked with couples who have good sexual communication. Good sex often requires good communication and trust between partners. While choosing to wait until marriage may have many benefits for some individuals, forcing young people to wait against their will means that individuals can't make the choices that are right for them. Individuals are less likely to develop these good relationship traits, therefore, and more likely to feel controlled or fear sex. Divorce in a marriage is a reflection of commitment, not happiness. It's possible that divorced partners are more happy overall than those who "stick with it". Research has shown that this likelihood decreased as people became more accepting of the likelihood of premarital sex. Waiting until marriage can have physical and psychological consequences when people eventually start having sex. More seriously, not waiting until marriage can cause death via sexually transmitted disease. Men who make virginity pledges struggle with sex even after they are married. They continue to view sex as a temptation for sins such as adultery and thus an urge that they must constantly control in case it leads them astray. This makes it difficult for them to transition to a healthy conception of sex once they are married. Abstinence can place an emphasis on developing other aspects of the relationship, such as communication and other forms of intimacy, which can benefit the relationship after marriage. Aspects such as communication, emotional compatibility, comfort-giving etc. are more important than sexual chemistry. These aspects are perpetually present in all spheres of the relationship, while sexual chemistry is exclusively restricted to the bedroom. Relationships in which both parties have strong sexual chemistry but are lacking in communication are less likely to be able to survive disputes and challenges. Particularly at the start of a relationship, prioritising sex can come at the expense of getting to know the other person better or developing skills in the relationship. Abstinence increases the likelihood of hasty partner selection to satisfy sexual desires, this would be bad for people because they might end up with someone who, in retrospect, they didn't want. Purity pledges help in avoiding the harmful side-effects of irresponsible teenage sex. Purity pledges reduce the amount of unwanted teenage pregnancies. A study showed that the more abstinence was stressed, the higher were the rates of teen pregnancy and births. A study showed that improved contraceptive use is responsible for 86 percent of the decline in the U.S. adolescent pregnancy rate between 1995 and 2002. The same study showed that 14% of the drop in teen pregnancy was abstinence. Individuals who break their pledge may feel a sense of guilt, an inability to ask for advice, and a fear of accessing sexual health clinics (Santelli, 27530260-4/pdf)). This impedes their ability to engage in safe sex. Parents often feel betrayed by children who break their pledges. This is likely to reduce the support these children have when they do become sexually active. A study found that purity pledges are linked to a higher risk of pregnancy and STDs. Purity pledges reduce the spreading of sexually transmitted diseases and infections. The only way to completely avoid STIs is through abstinence. A way of promoting abstinence is purity pledges. A study conducted between 2002 and 2008 showed that women who did or did not take purity pledges were equally likely to get HPV - about 27 percent of each group. Among women who had multiple sexual partners, pledge breakers were more likely to get HPV.
