Humans are primarily driven by emotions, rather than rationality. Societies at large act rationally. This allows us to infer that the individuals that make up society are rational too. Macroeconomic developments, such as the Phillips curve, follow rational expectations. Market anomalies exist, showing that many actions taken by market participants are irrational, affecting markets in micro and macro scale. Decisions to go to war often involve emotional responses, such as invading Afghanistan after 9/11. While the people may have supported the invasion due to an emotional/populist basis, the American government may have had a rational reason to invade, namely to bolster their geopolitical influence in the Middle East. Societal structure would collapse under purely emotional policy-making. Humans are capable of rational thought but this does not demonstrate that we are not primarily driven by emotions. Rationality is judged subjectively, which makes the very definition of rationality untenable. We look back on a great number of our actions and decisions and realise we may have acted in a more rational way. This reflective process suggests that humans privilege rational thinking over emotional thinking. Thought experiments repeatedly illustrate our decisions are swayed by emotional factors. Simple and classical test - the trolley problem. In the classical example, when there are 5 strangers vs 1 stranger, the results are simple - save 5 strangers. But when the one person is a relative, most people change their mind and decide to kill the five. Humans are highly subjective to emotional rhetoric, (e.g. Populism) suggesting a tendency towards subconscious decision-making. The fact humans are highly subjective to it, but not entirely driven by it in every instance, suggests that what is happening here is more a battle between rationality and emotionalism, whereby in the case of populism emotions win out. It does not, however, suggest rationality is non-existent. The manipulation of emotion, rather than rationality, in advertising is demonstrative of the market's acknowledgement that people make choices based more on emotion. The great number of scientific revelations and breakthroughs  made worldwide would have been impossible without rational thought. We have evolved to become self-conscious, which is impossible to achieve with emotions alone.
