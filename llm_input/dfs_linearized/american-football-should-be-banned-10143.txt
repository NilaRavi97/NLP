American Football Should Be Banned. Football is very popular, and a critical part of many communities. The Colosseum in Rome seated 50,000 spectators and was presumably popular.  Popularity of an activity does not imply the moral correctness of that activity. This is a misleading comparison, gladiators were slaves fighting to the death. Football forms the core identity of many colleges in the United States. A lot of the typical American college experience is built around the playing time and success of the college football team. A lot of schools have community based events like tailgates and parties before or after football games, which are essential for the enjoyment of students and their college experience. Inter-University Football rivalries form the core identity of many colleges. A connection to the college football team can build strong alumni networks that continue to support the college after graduation. Many colleges center their homecoming celebration around a football game. While this is the case for most universities, it can be undone. UAB reinstated football shortly after dropping it. It was dropped for political and financial reasons, not for moral ones. This would fundamentally change the college experience, making it less fulfilling for many students. University mission statements that define the core identity of the university do not mention football. This is true even for universities that are famous for their football programs. The University of Alabama's mission statement puts emphasis "...on quality programs in the areas of teaching, research and service." The mission of the University of Oklahoma is to provide the best possible educational experience. The Ohio State University's core values do not include football or competitive sports. Mission statements at universities often present and articulate a world view that is narrow, shallow, irrelevant and devoid of meaning. The National Football League, it's teams, and players provide much support to a variety of charities and causes.sbnation.com Football brings thousands of people together on a regular basis. Football forms the core identity of many states and cities. Celebrations after the Philadelphia Eagles' 2018 Super Bowl victory disintegrated into rioting and looting, ultimately costing the city thousands of dollars in damages. College or high-school football is the main source of identity and entertainment in many smaller/rural towns. College football accounts for a significant amount of money that the school would not have received otherwise. This money can go to supplies, new classes, facilities, etc. Communities evolve and can collectivise around other sports or cultural activities. The costs of changing deeply held cultural beliefs and practices are greater than the benefits of banning football. There are long traditions supporting baseball and basketball in many communities, and this could be shared with new communities. There are many opressive activities that are important to communities. This does not mean that they should not be banned. Given how central football is for many communities, it should be reformed rather than banned. The culture around football is very bad for society. Some high school and college students receive an unfair advantage in school because of their perceived benefit to their football team. Football players receive scholarships, because they bring in money for schools. However, the classes they take do not benefit them outside of football (like underwater basket-weaving). In the end, if football players get hurt or lose their scholarship, their career just about ends due to a lack of a capability to fall back on something better. More than a dozen NCAA programs were found to have committed academic fraud recently. High school football players get away easier than other students for behavioural transgressions. The negative cultural impacts of football are overstated. It has become common practice for media outlets to run stories about the criminal tendencies of NFL players in the wake of major arrests. However, they are less likely to be arrested on assault and drug charges. A detailed statistical analysis revealed that the overall arrest rate for NFL players — when compared with other men in their age range — is just 13 percent of the national average. People tend to easily overlook the positive impact players have on society off the field. Football players have a unique ability to raise awareness and public discourse on important social issues. Colin Kaepernick was able to generate valuable public discourse on institutional racism in the United States by refusing to stand for the national anthem at NFL games. Brandon Marshall has raised awareness and funding for the treatment of various mental health conditions through his charity, Project 375. Peyton Manning is a strong advocate for the rights of underprivileged youth, especially in America's inner cities. He has done this through public advocacy through his playing career and by co-founding the Peyback Foundation along with his wife. Some players, like Cardale Jones, have used their influence to actively harm society by publicly discouraging young athletes from trying in school. The NFL foundation has raised millions of dollars for charitable causes. The culture surrounding football isn't meaningfully distinct from the culture of other sports. Saw a HS football player injured at a game when his parents weren't there.  Vitals were stable & didn't warrant transport to hosp., but the kid just didn't get better.  No parents to consult so he was left with coach for observation.  Coach never checked up on him.  Finally sent him to hosp. anyway & they found a slow bleed in spleen.  Coaches focused solely on winning to the exclusion of this kid's health.  There's too much of that, & I have difficulty supporting that in a kid's sport. The NFL has an ongoing history of racism against black players. There has long been a racial divide in which position Black players are accepted playing. Given the high risk of concussions, those most likely to play football are thosecoerced by their circumstances, often poorer black men. Football set in motion nationwide protest for a more equal society when players decide to kneel. The NFL was not willing to stand by black players when it's revenue streams were threatened. The NFL does not set black players up for long-term financial success: over 80% of players are either bankrupt or in financial peril just two years after retirement. This is an argument to change the NFL to make it more inclusive, not to ban it outright. Football promotes comradery, social interaction and pride in one's hometown or school if an individual chooses to participate as an athlete or a fan. American Football players have a negative influence on the rest of society. A lot of Football players are paragons of success for their communities. A lot of Football players are role models to young kids of similar backgrounds to their own. Many Football players are infamous for getting away with crimes. Ray Lewis was implicated in a fatal stabbing in 2000. After striking a deal with prosecutors, he was sentenced to 12 months probation. American Football players tend to get away easier than other athletes for doping. This sets a bad precedent in world sport. People are willing to cover up horrible crimes in the interest of winning football games. Baylor University covered up, at minimum, 52 reported rapes in 4 years by their football players. Penn State covered up decades of child sex abuse to protect their football team. This is evidence of the moral shortcomings of the people in these cases, not of American football itself. There have been multiples examples of high schools and universities covering up sexual assaults for star players. One journalist explains that the motivation for covering up these crimes results from the lack of job security of coaches and the relatively high financial reward for winning. American football is a win-lose situation, where even if football players win in a football game, their wins don't lead to benefits later in life (as it is a short career with potential for not getting another one afterwards due to injuries and cover-ups) Most sports involve winning and losing that does not translate to "victories" later in life.  If you accept this line of logic, one should ban most other sports as well. American Football is a special case because of the especially high physical cost and especially low compensation. The dangers of football are grossly oversold.  It is a game that in the 1960s still saw player fatalities yet by 1990 was to a level of safety that even serious player injuries were largely gone.   Recent concern about brain injuries stems from grossly misleading data on brain degeneration - data disputed by the last two (2012 and 2016) International Conferences On Concussion In Sport and internally contradictory with more careful reading.   Safety of players and equipment continues to grow. American football is too dangerous to be permitted. Catastrophic spinal cord injuries are significant life-changing events and can sometimes result in death. From 2004 to 2009, there were three reported catastrophic spinal cord injuries in college football. There is a certain amount of risk associated with all college sports, which athletes receive fair warnings of beforehand. There are reports of paralysis and other severe injuries arising from the play of rugby, but there's no call to ban rugby as a sport. Daryl Stingley's career as a receiver for the New England Patriots was cut short because of a head-on collision with Oakland Raider safety Jack Tatum, rendering him paralyzed from the neck down. Professional players lose, on average, three years of life expectancy for every year they play professional football. The rate of dementia at 50 years of age is 5 times higher among men who played American Football than men who did not. Football is linked to traumatic brain injury. Dr. Frank Conidi reported that more than 40% of retired NFL players show evidence of abnormal brain structures. Football is associated with Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which typically entails behavioral problems, mood problems, and problems with thinking. One large study found that 110 out of 111 (99%) deceased NFL players had chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The sample suffered from selection bias. The players who donated their brains to the study were the ones experiencing cognitive issues. This selection bias was in many ways caused by the NFL due to their hostility towards research into CTE, or any possibly harms, caused by American Football. The NFL tried to cover up the long-term brain damage caused by American Football. The NFL used their funding of concussion research to try to influence the results. The documentary 'League of Denial' details two decades of the NFL's efforts to suppress research on health impacts of football, and discredit research that made it into the public sphere. This campaign slowed down, and halted, much research being completed, and made available to the public. In the decades of this campaign many more athletes incurred damaging, life-threatening, and even fatal, injuries. The suppression effort affected the documentary itself: there was a campaign to label the film as biased against the NFL and ESPN broke ties with PBS after the trailer for the documentary was released. The researcher who discovered CTE, Dr. Omalu, was the target of a smear campaign by the NFL, ultimately forcing him to leave his job. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease found in people who have had multiple head injuries. NFL sponsored research omitted the results of over 100 concussions to influence the results of the research. There's more to the story than a cover up. The NFLPA (NFL Players Association) failed to represent the interests, so they share part of the blame. This does not absolve the NFL of culpability. The NFL has invested in preventing, diagnosing and treating head injuries. Given the NFL's prior cover-up campaign, they have shown clear bias, and cannot be trusted to now help address problems they, until recently, actively dismissed. Last year it announced a $100 million concussion initiative aimed at making the game safer. Of that amount, $60 million will go to tech innovation and $40 million will go to medical research. The NFL launched the Head Health Challenge, a competition to encourage companies to study and develop products to improve player safety. Studies that compared recreational football players to those with alternative pastimes during their childhood found that there was no difference in numbers of adults who went on to develop neurodegenerative illnesses between those who had played American football and those who had instead been in a school choir or other activity. The human body simply cannot handle the speeds at which football players, especially at the major college and pro levels, collide. People should be able to allowed to consent into dangerous activities. People should only be free to take on reasonable risks, but risk affiliated with Football is unreasonable. The NFL has not been honest about the risk of playing; people cannot consent into risks they do not know. This is an argument to regulate the NFL governing body to be fairer and more transparent, not an argument to ban the playing of the sport at all levels. While not disagreeing that people should know risks before they consent, one can hold the bar too high.  There will always be unknowns, and it is fairly obvious that football involves the potential for very serious physical injuries. People can not expect inside sources to provide unbiased information, and should instead look to extensive outside sources and unbiased scientific research, and corroborate an understanding based on both supportive and counter articles. There is no universal method for deciding whether something is reasonable or not. Even though there's no universal method, there are many reasonable ones. Laws across the world are formulated and punishments are issued for their violation keeping in mind whether certain actions are reasonable or not. People should be free to take every risk they want, as they decide by themselves what is reasonable and what is not. The ability to consent to dangerous acts is fundamental to our freedom and autonomy. People should not have the ability to exercise their autonomy to undertake actions that could be detrimental to their self interest. People are not allowed to not wear seat-belts while driving because it is against their own interest to do so. Children are too young to meaningfully understand and consent into the potential long-term damage of football. Parental consent is required for children to play competitive football. Just because a parent consents to something does not make it safe; this is why we place limits on parental rights. Limits to parental powers of consent are unrelated to the problem of coercion. While parental consent does not mitigate potential harm, it mitigates coercion. Parents are biased toward letting their children play the sport because of various factors, and as such, their decision to let their children play could be coerced. A lot of parents are big fans of the sport and want to be known as the father/mother of a star athlete. A lot of parents feel an elevation of social status in their communities if their child becomes a sports star. This is magnified in the case of American Football because the stardom associated with it is much greater than in other sports. A lot of parents see their kids playing professional football as a gateway to get out of poverty, or at the very least, a gateway to the elevation of the family's economic status. Parents may be biased toward letting their children play football since their financial obligations to their child could be significantly reduced if their child was able to secure a sponsorship/college scholarship. Arguments of bias in parenting decisions could be equally said of allowing children to become actors, or pop musicians or astronauts (areas where there is risk and/or social bias). While parents may have biases in making parenting decisions, these affect all of their decisions (unless the state takes that decision from them). Allowing a child play football is not markedly distinct from other parental choices. Parental consent forms contain all of the relevant information needed for parents to make informed decisions. It is possible for individuals to not thoroughly evaluate risks before consenting to an activity, especially if the activity is popular among peers. For such activities, regulations should be made to ensure that their potential performers are fully aware of the consequences before they proceed. A person's liberty to engage in risky behaviors is limited by the risk it puts on other people (i.e. you can't drive drunk because you might kill someone else). If the cost of the risk of football is externalized to the rest of society, then it shouldn't be allowed. Most football (high school, etc) happens with no increased regard for risk and thus externalizes it onto society via health insurance premiums and other costs. Dangerous activities have an impact on society as we provide medical care and other community safety systems. What one person may consent to does sometimes have an impact on other people. When someone sustains a severe enough injury, members of the community must spend time and money to help them recover. The setup of the American health system means the cost of sports injuries is not borne by the state, but instead athletes are covered by team or university insurance schemes, or the athlete themselves bears the high costs of recovery. Consenting adults are allowed to participate in a host of dangerous activities for pleasure, such as MMA, wrestling, boxing, skydiving, cableing and rapelling, caving, cliff jumping and base jumping. These activities might pose a greater risk to physical health than American football because they are inherently dangerous. While American football is a sport that carries risks to participants, other sports that are widely enjoyed are more dangerous than American football. Skiing, equestrian sports and even cycling are deemed more dangerous. Risk taking behaviours should not be discouraged through banning sports such as American Football. These behaviours are important to society in many roles, such as space exploration and rescue personnel. There isn't a cultural phenomenon surrounding any of the above listed activities. The extent to which American Football permeates the day to day life of the average American makes it unique in terms of the scope and degree of harm it can cause. An activity's degree of popularity has no effect on its level of safety. If such hazardous activities are legal for the general public, football should be as well. The cultural phenomenon around football in the US leads to more opportunities - educational and professional - for its players in comparison to the above listed activities, which are equally hazardous. American football can be made safer for players without banning it outright. Heart issues, heat illness, and respiratory conditions rank among the top causes of death according to the NCAA. These deaths can be prevented without changing the rules of the game. Many commentators have expressed views that instead of banning football, helmets and headfirst collisions should be banned. While making American football safe would be an alternative to banning it outright, actually doing so is incredibly difficult. Even weaker impacts can cause brain damage because of the whiplash. A sudden stop is all it takes to cause an injury. As long as the sport involves players ramming into one another, brain injury will be a possibility. As long as cars are around, humans are at risk to dying of car crashes. However, modern technology has mitigated the risk of injury and death significantly enough to make driving a car a reasonable decision for anyone to make. The same logic can be extended to football as well. No matter to what extent rules are changed, American football will always remain a contact sport that encourages players implicitly to hurt their opposition. This is systemic to the nature of the sport. Nothing can stop the brain from slamming against the inside of the skull.  No matter how hard you try, and no matter what rules or technology you use, concussions and CTE will never be cleansed from the sport. This is the worst case scenario that can be avoided. By this logic, injury and risk is inherent to many activities and sports and all ought be banned. Clearly this is not the case. Rule changes and better sideline procedures for dealing with potential head injuries have made the sport safer for those involved. This is likely to continue in the long term. There is intensive research into shock absorbing materials that could be used to line helmets in the future. The NFL has continued to change rules nearly every year to make the game safer since 1985. Increased protection, neck training and changing the location of kick offs are all examples of changes that have been implemented to increase safety for players. Reforming the way football is played would be preferable to a ban. The culture surrounding football and its inherent danger are such that no reforms are possible that would leave a non-exploitative form of the game. The NFL is a harmful institution. The NFL provides economic benefits and job opportunities to thousands of people apart from athletes. Coaches, janitorial staff, web developers, stadium and player managers, advertisers and doctors have jobs because of the popularity and scale of the NFL. In the long term, people who attend games or work for the team generate new spending in the community, expanding local employment. Successful teams attract national and international tourists, bringing more money to successful cities. A study found that a new sports facility has an extremely small (perhaps even negative) effect on overall economic activity and employment. The net gain to Baltimore’s economy from building Camden Yards in terms of new jobs and incremental tax revenues is only about $3 million a year—not much of a return on a $200 million investment. The opportunity cost of these economic benefits is that the NFL has shown it can (and has previously) prioritise profit over the welfare of players, or morality. The NFL tacitly supported spousal abuse by giving Ray Rice a two game suspension after he was recorded beating his then fiancee unconscious. A punishment that NFL commentators, players, and abuse advocates all agreed was minimal. American football was nearly banned 110 years ago.  In light of the violent nature of the game, perhaps the reasons mentioned for banning the sport over a century ago should be revisited. Football promotes athleticism and competition. Other athletic activities promote athleticism and competition without nearly as many risks. Tennis, baseball, and basketball all promote athleticism and competition without nearly as much risk as American football. The popularity of football means many young people try it out when they wouldn't try other sports. Football promotes unhealthy forms of these virtues. Unhealthy levels of competition, especially at the lower levels, can have detrimental impact on young players' mental health. Amateur and highschool football teams don't have the finances or public infrastructure to give athletes the levels of support they require. Intense pressure and competitiveness causes early burnout in atheletes - sometimes at ages as low as 9 or 10. This is an argument that the pressure and competitiveness of football should be limited, especially for younger players.  This point does not mean that football necessarily requires intense pressure and competitiveness. The promotion of unhealthy forms of competitiveness is uncommon and can be corrected through hiring better coaches and staff. Football encourages holistic development of students when they are in high school and college. While football may promote holistic development, that is overshadowed by the financial benefits to the sport. High school students become focused on potential football scholarships to the detriment of other subjects or developing other skills, and college athletes prioritize the money to be earned through football to the detriment of their academic work. Football helps students and teachers value athleticism and teamwork as important and essential for growth. It brings a world view of local areas which can lead to big business through rooting interest. It shows the value of hard work along with team work from pee wee on up...it unites a community. I know some players, owners and fans do criminal things but it's not as whole. Football empowers generations of families. It's OK still to be a rugged man there is no laws in the USA yet that requires all men to be soft and gentle. Football is one of the most gruelling sports in the world for players, both physically and mentally. The gruelling nature of the sport includes constant high intensity practice which can become dangerous for professional football players. At the Pittsburgh Steelers training camp, the intensity of the workout causes players to sweat several pounds of water per day. Even on the collegiate and high school levels, multiple people die per year at practice. Football players usually have to keep convoluted, data driven tactics in mind while playing. Every level of football is on some level exploitative. If adult players consent to play on a team, then they are not being exploited. Accepting payment below the minimum wage because it is the only option is a decision an adult can make but society still recognizes it as exploitative and puts in place measures to rectify it. Exploitativeness is not a problem limited to Football, but affects all forms of professional sports. Football's exploitation problem is significantly worse than other sports. Football players are subject to more severe long-term health problems. Football players often have to use dangerous amounts of painkillers simply to survive the season. Professional football players are the only major-sport athletes in the US to not have guaranteed contracts. This means that if players are injured or have a bad season, they are not guaranteed a spot in the next line up, which forces players to ignore their physical and mental health in order to keep their job. The NCAA uses strict regulations to force college athletes to play full time while getting little to no compensation. Professional Football is exploitative. Traumatic brain injuries are more common in Football than in any other sport. Even with the earnings they get, many football players go bankrupt. Professional football players are very well compensated for their participation and are not compelled to remain football players. Youth football is exploitative. High School football is exploitative. High School football is more beneficial than harmful. High school football gives athletes who might not be great academically, chances to compete for scholarships that could give them a great college education. It is impossible to weigh the harm of football for a young athlete against the benefits, given the potential for long-term harm varies. One young person may experience no long-term damage while another may die from CTE. A lot of student athletes who might have dropped out of high school otherwise stay in school and graduate because of football. High school football gives young kids lessons in teamwork, hardwork and sportsmanship that they otherwise would not learn in classrooms. High school football is good for students who are not directly involved in the teams as well. A lot of students form bonds and friendships out of their shared interest in the sport and their love for their own highschool team. Students go to games together, cheer their team on together and follow their teams to 'away' games. This strengthens relationships and builds a unique sense of comeraderie. Many students discover hobbies or passions in coaching, marketing, cheerleading or sports analytics as a result of following their high school team. Passion for highschool football forms a culture that is inherently exclusionary to the students who do not want to follow the sport. Students who prefer to not follow the sport are looked upon as nerds or generally uncool and are often excluded from other social interactions. This can be the case surrounding any competitive high school sport or extra curricular activity and is not limited to just football. High school football culture gives employment to coaches, janitorial staff and other individuals that are responsible for supporting the team. High school football teams help discover and hone athletic talents in students who would otherwise go untrained. Players face many of the same health risks as college football, without the benefit of a free education or payment. College football is exploitative. Players are often forced into easy majors to pad their GPAs, in a tactic known as 'majoring in eligibility." 27 schools collect more than $100 million in revenue from football, and players cannot play if they accept any form of compensation. College football players are forced to sign away the rights to their names and likenesses. Most top-level college football players are on year-to-year scholarships, that can be revoked for any reason. This means that players are coerced into playing injured or skipping class to appease the coach. College football provides more benefits than harms for college athletes. Football scholarships allow student athlethes who otherwise would not have the academic credentials to get into a top program, the ability to get a good education. College athletes are respected members of the college community. College athletes use their positions to get away with committing crimes on campus. Brock Turner, a Stanford University swimming champion, was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman. He was only given a 6 month sentence because of testimony by character witnesses who spoke of his swimming career and his performance in school. He was later released after only serving half of his sentence. Florida State University had a policy of protecting football players internally and from the law. Children's brains are less developed, which means they are more at risk of brain damage. Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) incurred by a child do more damage to their brains than the damage caused by the same injury to an adult brain. The damage caused to a brain that is still developing can stall that development, making concussions and other injuries more dangerous for children and teenagers. The benefits of youth football for young athletes outweighs the harm brought about by exploitation. The game of football is not essentially exploitative. It is possible to play a game of football without exploiting anyone. Rather than banning football, we should ban what would make it exploitative. Football players often end up unable to work in other industries because of the injuries they suffer during their career. NY Post: How the NFL leaves players broken — and broke
