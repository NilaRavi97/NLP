Arranged Marriages are Better than Love Matches In arranged marriages, people may end up marrying people they dislike. "True love" discovered on one's own is as arbitrary as the love one feels in an arranged marriage. "True" love is about discovery, but you are never in control of the circumstances through which you meet your true love: it could be through friends, family, work, college, a one night stand, Tinder etc. For every person who identifies "true" love, there's millions of other potential partners they have ignored on the way to getting there. Therefore falling in love with someone met "naturally" is arbitrary. The only difference in arranged marriage is that this arbitrary person is picked by someone else, but all the consequences are still the same. People often truly love their biological parents and children, even though they don't get to choose them. There is no guarantee however that love will be found in an arranged marriage. In comparison, a love marriage would not take place with the absence of love. Since these marriages are arranged by third parties, it is unlikely that each partner would disclose their personal idiosyncrasies and negative personality traits at the time of entering the marriage. One can get to know their prospective partner in the process of getting into an arranged marriage. During the process of an arranged marriage families may fluff up their candidates by highlighting all the positive things and not the problems they might have, which one may otherwise identify through a relationship. A person may end up disliking their partner in a love marriage. Almost half of all marriages in the US end in divorce. People can change throughout a marriage. The person that someone may of married may no longer be the same person they fell in love with. It is better to live a part of one's life in a loving relationship that eventualy ends in divorce than to be stuck in an unwanted union without a way out. People might marry violent partners. This is neither unique to arranged marriage nor love marriage. Abusive relationships can exist irrespective of the way in which the relationship was initially formed. In a country dominated by arranged marriages, India has seen  more than 113,000 women report abuse by their husbands or in-laws in 2015. Further, 7,646 deaths were classified as related to dowry disputes. Women often get little choice and are married to abusive men in countries where arranged and semi-arranged marriages are common, such as India. Dating is a way to test a potential partner before committing to them. Arranged marriages, as they are put together in a relatively short time, may not have sufficiently gathered data before the marriage. It is relatively easy to hide negative aspects of your personality, such as a temper, over the short lead up to an arranged marriage. Psychopaths, narcissists and sociopaths are often very charming. It takes time to notice dangerous signs and arranged marriages do not allow for this amount of "getting to know one another" time. Domestic and sexual abuse is more common in arranged marriages, and the existence of arranged marriages systematically supports child marriage and sexual violence against minors.Forced and child marriages There is a significantly higher level of domestic violence in arranged marriages as apposed to love marriages in Turkey. Due to the social stigma associated with divorce, couples, especially women, may stay in an abusive or toxic relations while hiding the problem. Thus, arranged marriages leave women vulnerable to abuse. The meeting of potential spouses is usually arranged by families, but the decision to ultimately marry usually lies with the couple. A UK study found 45 percent of mothers who identified themselves as being from a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background (i.e. arranged marriages) described themselves as “very happy” in their relationship compared with only 34 per cent of “white” mothers. Arranged marriage couples may not divorce because of the social stigma associated with it. Since their family made the choice of their partner, couples may be hesitant to divorce because their families are involved. Arranged marriages in developing countries like Pakistan are often cousin marriages. In these specific cases, getting a divorce is even more difficult due to familial concerns. A research on thelinks between religion and relationship stability in UK found that 45 per cent of mothers who identified themselves as being from a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background described themselves as “very happy” in their relationship compared with only 34 per cent of “white” mothers. The absence of the expectation (often unreal) that a ‘perfect partner’ exists, makes the relation happier, because both partners enter the marriage conscious that will have to work hard on their relationship out of the material they are given. Couples may be forced to stay in arranged marriages by family members who have been instrumental in the marriage happening to begin with. You have no control about the criteria your parents or family members may apply to select potential matches for you. Parents could possibly be accommodating in their search for a prospective partner if children are willing to discuss the issue with their parents. Arranged marriages take away peoples' agency to choose their own life partner. It is exactly the lack of agency in choosing a life partner that can facilitate a mindset for individuals in arranged marriages to make the best of the situation going forward, setting the scene for a possibly stronger marriage with active effort rather than disappointment from long-held expectations. With proper knowledge about hardships of relation you could work to build well fundaments for relation with chosen partner too. In societies who practice arranged marriages, the individual's sexual orientation is disregarded. In effect, this means LGBTQ+ people are either forced to disregard their orientation and conform, or be considered outcasts. Gay arranged marriages have taken place in India. While they are not common, this demonstrates that the process of arranged marriage does not have to be only for heterosexual couples. While there have been some instances of LGBTQ+ individuals being forced into arranged heterosexual marriages these marriages are considered forced marriages and not arranged marriages. To engage in an arranged marriage both parties involved must consent to the marriage. Left to their own devices people often choose the wrong life partner anyway. Divorce rates around the world demonstrate that people are not successful with one of the biggest choices in their lives. Whether it is financial freedom or personal freedom, the ability to be free contributes to an easier and happier life. Arranged marriages impacts one's freedom in making an important life decision and can make life harder and in some cases miserable. The violation of a person's agency to choose does not matter if the outcomes of an arranged marriage are better than those of a love marriage. There are many social structures like rules, laws and customs that strip individuals of agency for a greater good to the individual or community. Therefore, outcomes matter more than the individual's ability to exercise decisions in a particular scenario. Even though this may be true, it can be argued that marriage is one of those instances where it is unjust or not pragmatic to have a third party make decisions on an individual's behalf. Rules, laws and customs can also be seen as a way to protect the agency of individuals from aggression. Therefore there is no reason to think that outcomes matter more than agency. Most benefits of arranged marriages appear to be due to a higher awareness of the importance of working on a relationship, which could also be achieved in a love marriage with proper education. Many people in love marriages are also aware of the importance of working on relationships. It is more dependent on the couple and whether they are prepared to work on the marriage, rather than due to whether they have received ''proper education". Removing a persons agency takes away their humanity. Any outcome would therefore be irrelevant since they are now less (nor even not) people. It depends on the definition of "arranged". There are practices of arranged marriage where parents make a recommendation and encourage them to get to know each other. But eventually, the kids have a chance to say "no". Emotions are too malleable and fluid for one to base their life around them and love is no exception. Love is an emotion like any other, caused by the secretion of chemicals into the bloodstream and into the brain. Instead of focusing on love, one should focus on making decisions that will tangibly improve one's life. All physiological sensations and internal emotions are triggered by chemical reactions in the brain and in the body. This is not sufficient reason to disregard their merit. Pain and sadness are simply a chemical reaction, for example, but it's obviously wrong to needlessly hurt others. The feeling of the emotion of love does cause people to be happy. For some, this happiness might be more valuable than material possessions, money or more "measurable" parameters. Human beings believe in a lot of idealistic notions to make life easier. If love gives people happiness and satisfaction, there is not need to negate it. True love is one of most important factors of happiness in marriage. Love is often turbulent within a relationship. It has its ebbs and flows. A couple who gets into an arranged marriage without having affection for one another at the time of the marriage's conception may grow to love each other over time. Couples in arranged marriages tend to feel more love for one another as time goes on. Physical attraction is one of the major factors driving love marriages. Physical attraction however fades with time as people grow older, which can lead to undesirable results. While physical attraction is an important factor in starting a relationship, love marriages are rarely entered into based on it. They are decided upon after years of getting to know the other person and making sure that they have qualities which are compatible with their own. Couples in love marriages often confuse lust for love and may not in reality have very much in common. In comparison, those in arranged marriages are placed together because of similarities and common interests which are a good foundation for love. Irrespective of how the initial attraction takes place, any successful marriage requires flexibility, selflessness and sacrifices for it to succeed. This is more likely to happen when the couple has mutual feelings of love and respect before the marriage has taken place. Having your marriage organised mostly by your family demonstrates flexibility (in adapting to their choices), selflessness (in allowing their families’ preferences to be more important than their own), and making sacrifices in the same manner. These traits can be applied in the arranged marriage as well. Arranged marriages are made for stability rather than love, they normally happen just 6-7 months after meeting. People spend weeks preparing for interviews and people (particularly from a Asian background) do not even get the opportunity to meet the person they are possibly about to spend their life with. A marriage based on stability rather than love is not necessarily a bad thing. About 2 or 3 years of living with someone you don't really love - up to the time you would develop significant feelings - is hard. Being in a marriage with someone you don't love is not easy. Marriage comes with many responsibilities, benefits and lifelong implications. Marriage usually happens with the assumption of having kids and raising a family in the future. Married couples usually get many economic and social benefits from the state. It is possible to fall in and out of love during a marriage, there will be times when the relationship is better than at other times. Relationships don't stay the exact same throughout a long duration. Marriage is not easy full stop, even with someone you do love. In some cultures beingsingle is viewed as even more difficult than being in a loveless marriage. You cannot control who you develop feelings for. It may be difficult to accept in the beginning years, for people who enter into arranged marriages despite having feelings for other people, that they will never act on their feelings or pursue certain opportunities. Many people live with people they do not love and get along fine, such as in shared accommodation with roommates. A study found that arranged marriages lead to happier unions because couples worked harder to make their relationships work. Love couples rarely go in to detail about everything they want before they begin the relationship.  In the arranged relationships, potential partners can discuss all aspects of the relationship in advance (housing, chores, sex, work, vacations, friends, family, relaxation, etc.).  It creates a more honest relationship built on trust and respect, and once they agree their chances of success are far greater. A study in Jaipur, India found couples in love marriages were more in love for the first five years, compared to people in arranged marriages who were more in love for the next 30 years. What is viewed as "love" can often be just a coping mechanism. The couple settles into their roles and try to make the best out of the situation they were put into, getting used to one another and developing a relationship for the sake of peaceful coexistence. So do many abductees for their captors (stockholm syndrome). These are coping mechanisms that help people survive without losing their minds. Women are very good at developing feelings of chemistry over time however men are generally very bad at it. This indicates that not everyone can develop love or attraction over time. Painting either gender with the same brush across the board is an unfair thing to do. The parent claim is referring to scientific studies which show that different genders react differently in this circumstances. While generalising is wrong, one cannot ignore the biological and psychological differences between the genders, some of which have developed in response to societal rules. In an arranged marriage, the husband and wife are most likely to come from the same background which means they may share the same interests and memories of childhood. These shared experiences may contribute to the building of a strong relationship and a deep love for one another as time goes on. Non arranged marriages are also most likely to come from the same background. The periods of time in which partners feel their love for each other the most justifies the relationship. The fact that a lot of people believe in love makes it more than just a fickle idea. Since people believe that love exists, therefore they act and feel as if it were to exist. This makes love have a real effect. Love might exist, but that does not mean it is wise to base your life on it alone. There are many other forms of love other than romantic love, which can be nourished outside the financial and legal commitment a marriage is. Many people believe that love is the least malleable and fluid of all emotions. Love often lasts a lifetime. All long lasting bonds like friendship and familial relations are based on unconditional love. Nowadays it's rare even for love to last a lifetime. The love that many marriages are based on may not be unconditional. Love and arranged marriages are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Love is not just an emotion, but a decision to share your life with someone, to treat them well and to be able to do things that are hard, sometimes even painful, for their happines. Arranged marriages are more of a planned decision than a love marriage. Romantic love leads to sacrifices for the other half, so it's a firm ground to build a relationship on. Especially in love, emotions can be dangerous and distort the true situation with another person which can lead to bad decision making. Although arranged marriages lack the initial emotional connection with another person, instead they offer a business, financial and pragmatic solution. In the long run this provides stability rather than letting emotions prevail which can lead to bad decisions. Without emotions and passion, life is boring and monotonous. We need emotions to feel alive and human. Although love and emotions can be painful and destructive this is part of the rollercoaster of life. It is important to see marriage as the bigger picture. Emotions are important but there are often many variables that influence compatibility and complementarity in love and marriage. Core values are more important in the long run than initial emotions at the start of a relationship. People change over the years, therefore it is necessary to take into account a partner's values, integrity and traits like their willingness to work hard, how much they care about family etc. Emotions impact all aspects of life and all interactions, and are decision factors even when not acknowledged. Pretending they are not is foolishness. Arranged marriages often reinforce regressive social norms. Arranged marriages presume the problematic notion that children are the property of parents, not their own individuals. Arranged marriages offer a more stable environment (happier spouses (Madathil & Benshoff, 2009) (UK Marriage Foundation, 2016), lower divorce rate (wiki archive)) for children, which means that it is overall better - not only from a spouses' point of view. Just because parents advise their children into being part of a relationship does in no way make children lose their autonomy and become objects. A culture of arranged marriages stigmatizes couples that do want to marry because of love. Using regressive parameters like vital statistics, skin colour, religion/caste, and income to decide potential matches are common in arranged marriages. Individuals also use these characteristics often to find significant others. While all human beings are superficial to some degree, it is still better to let those who partake in the relationship to make their own judgements based on their own criteria, rather than leave the decision making to a third party, like in the case of arranged marriage. Not necessarily regressive but just traditional. Arranged marriages are a social norm in many countries and the beginning of a true adult life, while marrying for love is a relatively recent concept. Arranged marriage was the norm in Western European societies until the late 1700s, when romantic love and personal choice began emerging as social ideals. Marrying for love is a relatively recent concept. Arranged marriage was the norm in Western European societies until the late 1700s, when romantic love and personal choice began emerging as social ideals. Often an "arranged marriage" can be a disguise for a forced marriage. Afine line exists between forced and arranged marriage, yet sometimes this is blurred. Arranged marriage takes place only with full agreement and consent from both parties. While forced marriage, is when either the bride or the groom does not consent to marriage, and an element of duress, physical, emotional or both, is involved. It can be difficult for either the bride or the groom to actively consent into the marriage when external forces such as family expectation influence their actions. Arranged marriages also encourage regressive social customs. A lot of Indian arranged marriages revolve around demands for dowry. Oftentimes women are put through humiliating virginity tests as a part of arranged marriage. Because the individuals' marriage has been organized by their families, they can expect a greater degree of familial interference in their everyday lives which they might not want or feel comfortable with. Individuals will also be compelled into partaking in familial events a lot more. Cultural differences sometimes make social customs that might not apply in western liberal democracies to be more applicable in other countries. Ideas like combined families have largely been dismissed by western liberal democracies but in many third world countries combined families are more practical since they reduce the usage of already limited resources. Combined families allow a lot more interdependence and exchanging of roles between multiple breadwinners and individuals within one household ensures that the family has a greater degree of stability. Cultural relativism does not render all practices acceptable. Regressive social norms that oppress certain groups are common in some societies, and are not exclusive to the institution of marriage. Demands for dowry, unfair marriage contracts and evaluation of a woman's worthiness to be a bride on the basis of social or economic standing are directly related and endorsed by the institution of arranged marriage. Demands for dowry and a woman's worthiness to be a bride based on her social or economic standing are examples that can be explained by the influence of religious and cultural values in certain societies. These values are not a specific requirement in order for a union between two people to be valid through an arranged marriage. Financial security is important for any marriage to work. The cost of living in a house, paying for food and providing a good education for children can be very expensive. Hence it can be argued that seeking a partner who is able to adequately contribute financially is not a regressive norm, but rather a practical consideration for individuals looking to get married, whether the marriage is arranged or not. Neither the bride nor the groom would be arranged to marry "below" their social status, so whatever determines social status (caste, religion, skin color, wealth, or a mix thereof) is being reinforced. Arranged marriages can often be to spouses with a lower social status. For instance a high class family might marry a daughter to a lower class, but extremely wealthy spouse. Since the family wants to sustain its values by picking their children's spouses, it would be a logical extension that they'd want their own lifestyle to be reflected in that of their children. In communities where it is practiced, participating in an arranged marriage gives the couple wider social acceptance. What matters the most is whether two individuals feel that they are right for one another based on their own needs, rather than the approval of society. If two people are happy with each other, then the approval of society is irrelevant. This is much easier said than done, especially when that couple is dependent on that surrounding society for economic opportunities and as a social support system. Precisely because such marriages happen in constrained and oppressive environments, where social acceptance supersedes love between two people, love has to be given up in favor of social pressures. Therefore arranged marriages can never be better than free flowing love between two individuals. Social acceptance can be really important in communities where intense discrimination can take place against individuals deemed to be acting inappropriately. Social acceptance is a requisite for people living in small, insular communities that don't have much access to economic opportunities or educational infrastructure outside of those communities themselves. Social acceptance is necessary in most communities, irrespective of economic or educational levels. Humans are social beings and desire to be accepted and respected by others. Arranged marriages create a social network between families more effectively than many love matches do. This can also promote that the marriage becomes a contract between families rather than a relationship between two individuals. Marriage is also a contract between the individuals in it. If individuals are capable of making such a contract, perhaps families should be too. These networks can provide financial support for one another and be mutually beneficial for both families. Marriages initially based in love can also provide financial support and be mutually beneficial. Arranged marriages are a tool which can be used to increase the social status of a family. Raising your social status by possibly jeopardizing your child's romantic future is not a moral thing to do. When social status can mean the difference between cyclical poverty and a decent standard of life, then it is reasonable. Parents spend inordinate amounts of time and money raising their child, this is a way for the child to give back to the family for that investment. In an arranged marriage, in general, the families, cultures and values (both cultural and religious) of both sides tend to be more compatible than in a love marriage, therefore leading to less compromise. Such a network is good, but it is of little importance in marriage, only a few people engage in marriage for this benefit. While individuals might not engage into a marriage for this benefit, having this benefit nonetheless is beneficial for you. In arranged marriages, since the families are involved, they can help the couple when there is any problem. The families can support the couple emotionally and provide help when needed, thereby creating a good ecosystem. Families are able to help their children in their marriages whether or not its an arranged marriage. This depends on the relationship between the parents and the child and not the type of marriage. Just because it is more widely accepted in the community does not mean that it is the best course of action for the individuals involved. Having a good marriage is never guaranteed. However, having your marriage socially accepted and reinforced would certainly go miles to help it stay functional. Arranged marriages being more functional doesn't mean that they are better than love marriages, it just means they're functional. 
For example, a website with all required text boxes may be functional but not as good as a pre-filled form with 50% fields pre populated. In communities where love marriage is more popular it could lead to lower social acceptance. In many communities it could be seen as reason marriage or forced marriage. If grandparent is true, therefore analogically love marriage would lead to wider social acceptance in communities, where it's popular. 
Therefore arranged marriage would lead to (at least) relatively lower acceptance. Such societies might be discriminating people in love marriages, therefore it's probably not important to achieve their acceptance. Regardless of how terrible the society around you is, a certain degree of acceptance is necessary in order to live in that community. Being completely ostracized from your community will make life impossible. Individuals who do end up going down that route find that living individually is very harsh in a society built around communal dependence. Accepting such a situation would lead to further discrimination and opposing it could lead others to do so by widening the circle of people who would accept it. In such a situation you could still rely on a small circle of individuals who are similar to you - they will provide you with necessary acceptance. Love marriage also contributes to a couple's social acceptance and a higher status and economical position in society. For many families their children's marriage is one of the most important events of their lives. It is not uncommon for weddings to cost the bride's family the majority of their life savings. This is largely to put on a big show to their community to show their family in a positive light in order to be socially accepted. Arranged marriage makes a person's life easier. Arranged marriage skirts the opportunity cost associated with finding a partner. In a world where people are hounded by competitive jobs, education and an overall high level of stress, the search for a life partner can create more stress than the benefit it ultimately provides. The opportunity cost of an arranged marriage exists in the form of all the things an individual misses out on, which would have been otherwise present in a love marriage. Meeting new people, having nights of passion with people you care about, and even having relationships fail - they're all part of the process that can teach us things about ourselves and can be important in defining who we are in the future. The opportunity cost associated with a love marriage is often what makes it successful. Love marriages allow partners to get to know each other's personal preferences and to understand what living with them might be like. Understanding these nuances of relationships might ultimately be what makes or breaks a marriage. If the ultimate goal is marriage then time spent in romantic relationships that don’t result in marriage is an inefficient use of one’s time. Arranged marriage is great for people lacking the social skills to match with a partner of their choice. The social skills learned in dating are crucial to having a successful relationship. The social skills and criteria useful for dating, like being outgoing and funny, are usually incongruous with social traits that are important in a relationship, like being kind and understanding. People in love marriages only enter into marriage after a lengthly dating period. During this period traits such as being kind and understanding are significantly more important than social skills. Arranged marriage shouldn't be used as a cushion to not develop one's self. Just because someone knows they will have an arranged marriage doesn't mean that they should give up on improving social skills. When you don't need to improve yourself to help your chances while dating, you have less incentive for personal growth. Social skills are still very important in arranged marriages. Parents will normally want their son/daughter to be with someone who is the best fit for their family, this also includes having the necessary social skills to successfully integrate. Marriage isn't one of those things where an individual ought to consider a shortcut. Just because an arranged marriage makes your life easier, that in no ways makes it a shortcut. Partners in arranged marriages may be more accommodating and open to their partners' needs since they're just starting out in a relationship and they have to meet their familial expectations. Meeting a third party's expectations is a poor incentive to act altruistically. This sense of obligation is unlikely to last in the long term. Many individuals in non-western countries feel a strong obligation towards their culture and norms throughout their entire life. Partners are likely to be less accommodating of each other because they could be resentful of the fact they have to spend the rest of their life with someone they didn't choose. This is equally true in many love marriages. There's a strong incentive to not have your in-laws hate you. For marriages chosen based on love, the chances are they already know the other person very well and therefore understand how to accommodate their partner and be comfortable together more than an arranged couple who don't know each other. A newly arranged couple is more likely to be eager to please due to not having much dating experience and never before being in a serious relationship. The normal "honeymoon period" might be extended in comparison to those who get married after being together for so long, since the new couple will still be getting to know each others' likes and dislikes in life. Getting crushes on others and knowing that you can never date them definitely doesn't make one's life easier. If you know from a young age that you will be in an arranged marriage a lot of choices can be taken from you when growing up. This happens not only in arranged marriages but also chosen marriages. There is always temptation and often people have to work hard at staying faithful during a marriage whether it is arranged or not. By eliminating the choice factor, arranged marriages remove a possible ground for conflict over choosing to marry each other. If neither of the spouses were ever in place to choose to marry each other, then neither could take offence at the other one's premarital deluding, done in order to achieve marriage benefits or any form of intimacy. Not having to consider whether to get married or when to propose makes the relationship from the beginning more pragmatic and predictable as already the outcome of marriage is a given. This means expectations are already shared about the future of the relationship and there is less uncertainty. Even if the choice factor is taken out of the marriage equation, the bride or groom could secretly not be happy with their family's choice and therefore they may be dealing with inner-conflict or conflict with their parents. Arranged marriages improve one's relationship with their family as they make a big life decision based on their family's advice. If an arranged marriage does not work out, it may result in even greater suffering for the families involved as the everyone in both families are invested in the marriage. An individual should not have to barter important life decisions in order to strengthen relationships with their family. An individual is not bartering important life decisions if they can get a happy marriage and strong relationships at the same time. Arranged marriage does not necessitate bad marriage. They are however giving up the opportunity to make a decision about who they will marry. While there is the possibility that it will work out, they have still surrendered their own input into one of the biggest decisions about their life. Individuals also may feel less to blame if the marriage falls apart. This can pan out negatively, if one of the couple is deeply unhappy in the marriage but feels like they can not get out of it since they do not want to disappoint their family. There is a huge amount of family pressure placed on the couple. Arranged marriage can become more about the family's desires and upholding reputation rather than considering the actual wife or husband involved. This reinforces tight knit families since they are involved with every aspect of their child's future. The arrangement is a huge decision and special mutual bonding between both bride and groom's families which cannot be replicated in love marriages. Arranged marriages brings families closer as the arrangement respects cultural and traditional values. Shared culture and commonality reinforces family relationships. Couples in arranged marriages don't have to go through the process of impressing and gaining acceptance into their partner's family. Individuals do need to do this most of the time, it just happens before they ingratiate themselves with the partner. In fact it's even more important than in love matches because families won't arrange the marriage unless they've been impressed sufficiently by the spouse. Since the families already made the decision for marriage to go ahead, they already have accepted the bride or groom into their family. While in love marriages it can be a challenge to please all family members and often there is a considerable amount of effort involved to convince them that they will be a good husband/wife. This can continue long after the wedding day. Research has found that one of the largest causes of long-term familial estrangement is due to parents not getting on with their son's wife. This is unlikely to happen with an arranged marriage where the parents have pre-approved their son's wife. There are many cases with arranged marriages where the cultural context forces people to lie about their past and future due to being judged by one's family. There is much more pressure to impress since it is not just one person but a whole family. There are situations where the bride/groom or family lie about crucial aspects such as health history, sexual history and financial assets. In today's busy modern world, it is difficult to meet potential partners and find someone to marry. Arranged marriage eliminates the struggle to find the perfect partner. Arranged marriages save precious time as modern dating can be a time-consuming process. This allows the bride and groom to be able to focus on other priorities in life. The couple can relax and be themselves without worrying too much about impressing the other as the outcome is already a given. This reduces a lot of pressure that others feel when meeting a new potential partner. This can mean that a lot of the initial excitement of what will happen when meeting someone new and interesting is lost. Not having to impress can sometimes lead to a tendency of laziness and no need in trying, this can reduce romance and the excitement of trying to impress during the first few dates. When someone is introduced to the person they are expected to spend the rest of their life with it is unlikely they will not care about impressing them. Marrying someone you barely know and trying to trust and love them is not in any way easy. Neither marriage option necessarily makes life easier. There are different advantages and disadvantages to both kinds of marriages, as is the case with most life choices. Arranged marriages last longer than love marriages. An arranged marriage removes the pressure to find the “perfect” partner before settling down and leads to a happier relationship. The ways in which arranged marriages are organised can cause a large level of stress in themselves. Young people can be primarily judged by looks, family and money when being considered for arranged marriages. Love can often be blind and may be less stressful than being judged as you would be for a job. Decisions based on emotions are less stable than those based on reason Studies have found no difference in satisfaction between people in arranged and love marriages. Correlation is not causation. Couples with arranged marriages come from traditional communities with alternative cultural explanations for longer lasting marriages. Arranged marriages possibly last longer due to a sense of duty that a marriage has to maintained because there was nobody else selected to remarry. This would in turn lead to lower happiness within the relationship, which can have severe impacts on the couple and those close to them. Like any other marriage, a couple may stay through an unhappy marriage for the sake of their families or their own children. Duration is no indicator of quality. Just because a marriage lasts longer does not make it a happy or fulfilling one for the parties involved. There is research to suggest that an average couples’ satisfaction with their marriage declines during the first years of marriage, and goes down further as time goes on. Even if arranged marriages last longer, love might be missing which makes love marriages better. Divorce is mostly connected with feelings. If there were no feelings from begining there is no reason to divorce, but also absention of important reason to be happy in such marriage. If there is no love, there could be no need to be angry with someone who cheated. Cheating wouldn't be as bad emotionaly for the person being cheated on in this type of relationship. Arranged marriages are more stable because the couple is picked for one another by people who are older and more experienced. Arranged marriages are only work if the person's parents and family understand their personality and expectations to a great extent. This is unlikely to happen on such a deeply personal level. People's opinions and judgments on what makes a good life partner are predicated on their own personal preferences and experiences. Since every human being is unique, its unlikely that this experience of a third party will be as useful as the person's own judgement in determining who they should spend their lives with. There are generational gaps which hinder the ability of parents and older family members from finding an adequate match for the person. Arranged marriages are decided by those with more experience. Love marriages are based on gut feelings of the inexperienced. Experience affords better decision making. Family members can't do better than individuals themselves in picking a mate. In conservative societies, there may be structural barriers that prevent individuals from finding a suitable life partner. Many young men and women may not have the required social skills to interact with the potential romantic partners in a casual setting. Arranged marriages help overcome such barriers. It may be difficult to meet single men and women in a social setting without attracting undue attention because of the stigma attached to dating and pre-marital sex. Parents are uniquely suited to find potential candidates for marriage for their children. It is safer for an individual looking to get married if the parents find a suitable partner from a network of friends that they have amassed over the years built on trust, rather than the individual finding a partner from a family that they do not know personally. Parents have raised the child and are well aware of their needs, likes and dislikes. Parent's often assume that their children have similar characteristics to themselves. It has been found that parent's notice similarities significantly more often than differences between themselves and their children. This could result in them choosing a partner for their child who suits their needs instead of their child's. Parents have a vested interest in making their children happy and are likely to search for matches that their children will genuinely like. Marrying off children is sometimes seen as a parental duty as opposed to something that parents do out of joy. A marriage is not just about the couple within it. The entire marriage contract has a social element in the form of the state's validation of your relationship. It may make marriages better if they incorporate familial validation too. Parents might have opposite interests than their children (e.g. choosing a partner according to their financial situation instead of their personality), ending up picking the wrong person. This presupposes that a child's parents have a greater understanding of their child's personality then they may actually have. Studies have found that parents may be the worst judge of their children. According to a study, the divorce rate of arranged marriages is less than 4% as opposed to 40% of marriages in the U.S. where partners chose who to marry of their own free will. Length of marriage may indicate a difficulty in the divorce process. Usually the unhappy partner is the wife (study). If the wife cannot make a one-sided decision to divorce, divorce rates remain low. India has one of the lowest divorce rates at 1% and it is a country where the majority of marriages are arranged. Arranged marriages last longer than love marriages because the cultural environments which allow them are also patriarchal societies in which women are forced by social norms and by lower financial status to stay in unhappy marriages. Arranged marriages tend to have a longer duration, since such traditional marriages are built on terms of commitment and duty rather than love and passion. This provides a much stronger base for companionship as at the end of everything, a marriage boils down to exactly those two factors. A relationship's length depends on individuals, not on the type of marriage. There is no one type of marriage system that guarantees success. Every marriage is subjective and it's success can only be measured in its own merits. While an arranged marriage may be better for some couples, that might not be the case across the board. People who come from societies where arranged marriage is the cultural norm will have more advantages in getting into one than those that come in a society where love marriage is the norm. Having other people around you with vastly different expectations from their marriages while you are in a marriage which is unconventional is a possible cause of friction in the relationship. Even if it is difficult to determine which is better, or marriage is largely subjective, it is still likely that one is at least on-balance better for more people. Whether one is better or not is unimportant if it is not possible to find out which is better. Getting accurate statistics on marriage success is impossible since there is no way to gauge that over such a huge group like the entire human race. Because every individual has such a subjective interpretation of marriage, there is no way to determine which system works better. Individuals have varying expectations while getting into a marriage and some will be bound to have more than others. It is difficult to measure which system of marriage is more successful. Although divorce statistics are available, the level of happiness or unhappiness in a marriage is very personal and cannot be measured easily. Love marriages are better because a marriage is about the relationship between the two people involved. Marriage is a massive commitment. It requires an individual to live with someone else for decades, raise children with them, and spend more time with them than basically anyone else. Without love to underpin this relationship, it is unlikely to be successful. Love is very much a western concept, while traditional cultures consider marriage as primarily an economicarrangement. Sex other than providing children, is perceived to be a potential distraction from more important issues, such as feeding the extended family and caring for elders in the family. Relationships are hard work and require a lot of compromise. While love as a romanticist notion may exist, its practical existence is highly dubious. Therefore, it may not be necessary to ascribe to a metaphysical idea for a relationship to endure. Loveis not present across all marriages. Except it isn't and hasn't been for most of history. Marriage has primarily been about social stability, ensuring children are well bred, raised properly and with support from both parents, and that the woman is cared for and properly compensated for her role in ensuring the future, as well as protected in less stable societies. It's only within the past century or two that the relationship has had much to do with it at all. A marriage based on love means that the partners choose each other everyday. In most normal marriages there will definitely be days where the partners do not "choose" each other. It is unrealistic to expect that everyday marriage is a blissful experience. This statement presupposes that a person loves the other for life.
