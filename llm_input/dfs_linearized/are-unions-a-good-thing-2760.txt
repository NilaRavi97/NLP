Unions Are Good Unions lead to better worker benefits, such as health-care. Union workers aren't forced to perform work searches when filing for unemployment because the union hall provides that service. By asserting their collective power, workers can demand that their needs are met broadly and equitably - in fact this is the only way to achieve workplace equality. Unions inhibit productivity. As a counter example, despite Germany's traditionally strong unions, the world's 4th largest economy is supported by lot of very successful global industry players. There aren't that many billionaires, though. There's no conclusive evidence that CBAs and workplace organization have any impact on student outcomes in education.shankerinstitute.org Unions increase the costs for everything. They do so in order to make the workplaces more safer and secure a financial future for their members. Unions do not inhibit productivity, but can enhance it.  This has been shown in studies published by the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. epi.org This reasoning indicates that productivity as a value trumps all the values in the workplace that unions may stand for e.g. rights, sustainability, personal dignity, expertise, etc. Productivity has increased drastically since 1970, but wages have not even increased enough to beat inflation. Unions help ensure equality in the workplace, if you're a Union Electrician it doesn't matter what your race, gender or sexual orientation is, you are paid equal to all other union electricians of the same skill level. Hard work is not rewarded by unions. Everyone gets the same pay regardless of skill or effort. The minimum wage is considered a bottom limit only, above which there is plenty of room to reward workers for better performance. Unions create wage and standards floors, which create price floors and disproportionately affect the poor. Unions also often make unfair demands of employers, with many unions crippling businesses by dropping profit percentages below a point in which the risk is worth running the business. Hard work should be compensated with promotion and bonuses, not minimum wages. Unions force workers to conform to and adopt their views. Union dues pay lobbyists to push agendas that may not align with the worker's values. Unions are a democratic outlet by which workers can actually have some say in the administration of the places in which they work. They are often the only space in which workers can express their own views and meaningfully challenge the views of the management. Unions can be organized peacefully and voluntarily.  A distinction should be drawn between voluntary union participation and unions with an enforced monopoly on labor in a given market. Unions risk making wage labor acceptable at the expense of the more widespread horizontal collectivization that greater dissatisfaction would prompt. Unions raise class consciousness and, during negotiations, make it more clear that companies want to pay them as little as possible in exchange for as much production as possible. This argument is completely invalid as no worker is forced to join a union. There are many occupations that require union membership, for example Las Vegas casino workers, teachers in most states, and every police officer in the country. The Nazi party might arguably have had the killing power to "force" people to "adopt their views", and yet the resistance happened. Unions are not more powerful than armed Nazis. Unions ensure that the workers are not abused by their employer. Unions prevent asymmetric information in wage negotiations.civicskunk.works Employers have most of the power in the employee/employer relationship. Unions can help balance that relationship. Unions allow their employers to address their workers grievances collectively, rather than individually. Unions give workers the ability to negotiate with their employers. Contracts are assumed to be agreements between entities of equal standing.  Thinking that an individual worker has equal standing with a large corporation is not reasonable.  Only large collectives of workers have any hope of negotiating on equal footing with large corporations. Unions use to have a place. We now have sufficient employment laws making unions obsolete. These days, they encourage a "them vs us" attitude between staff and management, which creates a bad attitude towards work. The "us vs them" attitude between staff and management can be mitigated with good training, like impact offers to Ironworker Forepersons and to Ironworker Job Stewards. Unions prevent workplace accidents. Unions often implement drug testing, which prevents work while impaired. Company policies and well trained, skilled workers prevent more accidents than unions. Unions can coexist with companies, thereby making the workplace even safer. Unions could take care of basic & introductory training, while company resources could be applied to advancing their fields. Union prevention of accidents is valuable even in addition to company policies and training which, possibly or probably, exist because of previous union involvement. Unions can be organized democratically and need not promote conformism. A strong trade union encourages a diversity of viewpoints as well as education that is empirically based regarding realities corresponding to workers' needs. Unions provide better training for their employees, which leads to better quality workmanship. Companies should provide training to increase their productivity. Those who don't would eventually be unable to compete in the market. The cost burden for this training should lie with the worker who receives the training, not with the company. The Unions paying for this training are providing that benefit to their signatory companies. Unions take money from the workers. Unionized workers make substantially more money than their non-union counterparts. The extra $3.51 per hour (\>$7,300 per year)made by union workers far surpasses the $400 per year that the average union worker pays in dues. Unions prevents a race to the bottom and wage stagnation. Unions do not take money from workers in the sense of a useless payment, but do involve dues to provide services and wages for organizers who fight to increase the wages of members. Most union dues are tax write-offs that workers get reimbursed for at the end of the year. An example of this happening would be in Canada. Unions tend to be corrupt. Unions form networks which tend towards isolation and consequent monopoly which is separation manifested. Protectionism is already a red flag of systemic imbalances. Union participation in the public sector gives too much leverage to the unions, which allows for extortion. All profits in the capitalist mode of production derive from the unpaid wages of labor.  The only extortion that takes place is the coercive nature of waged employment.  Unions fight for an even playing field with capital so that workers are not extorted or exploited. Unions are violent. Nearly every death that has occurred during an American union struggle has been has been murder committed on behalf of management (and there have been many). Unions are neither good or bad. The leadership of unions, whether local shops or on the national level, determines their dynamic. The larger the employer the more necessary a union becomes to prevent the hierarchy from becoming tyrannical. Unions themselves eventually become a large employer with self interests as higher priority than worker interests. Unions were formed to protect against unscrupulous private employers. Assuming the employer in the public sector is 'the people' unionising in the public sector is self defeating. Especially the workforces that manage public goods like energy, water, transportation and health should not be allowed to unionise, so as to safeguard from the potential extortion of the general public by a small group of individuals.
