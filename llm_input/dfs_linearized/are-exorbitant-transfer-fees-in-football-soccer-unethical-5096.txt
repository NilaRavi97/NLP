Exorbitant transfer fees in football (soccer) are ethical. If transfer fees didn't exist players would receive higher wages instead. Removing them will damage agents and related industry. Football clubs often put themselves at financial risk trying to be competitive. The money can be better spent on infrastructure or reducing ticket prices. Costs are passed on to ordinary supporters, meaning not everybody can afford to enjoy the sport live. Transfer fees are an avenue for corruption. High profile players such as Neymar have been involved in corruption charges associated with transfer fees. With so much money at play, it is highly probable that those involved will find ways to twist the system to their advantage. Poorer clubs benefit when they sell players on for fees. Transfer fees for footballers are perverse in a world full of poverty Transfer fees enable rewards without merit. Agents who have had no part in player development become rich with minimal contribution. Wealthier football clubs gain an unfair advantage. Football clubs need to be compensated for the time and effort taken when developing players. Transfer fees have negative effects on individual players. Large fees can inflate players' egos. Players are put under pressure if they have large fees. They fees paid are determined by the market. If a club is willing to spend Â£X million on a player then it is because both parties are happy that this deal is fair. In this sense it is as ethical as much as market economics is ethical. Putting a monetary price on humans is unethical. The transfer fee is compensation for ending a contract early; factors affecting the fee include how long the contract had left to run. It's therefore not correct to term this purely as a value placed on the player themselves. Discussions about potential fees make football more exciting.
