Humans are fundamentally different from other animals. Humans do not have enough comprehension about animals' language and reasoning to know for certain whether humans are fundamentally different from animals. Arguments have been made that dolphins are as intelligent, if not more so, than humans, but are limited by their lack of limbs and communication. Currently we teach dolphins to respond to American Sign Language, a form of communication they can not produce themselves. Humans are physically and biologically unique. Humans have an advanced neo-cortex (The mental parts we share with other animals have allowed us the safety within which to evolve this.). Every living creature is physically and biologically unique. Humans are intellectually superior to other beings on Earth. Humans ask questions such as these, showing that their ability to contemplate life is significantly more advanced than animals. Not enough is known about the cognitive abilities of many animals to conclude that they're not equally capable of posing and contemplating questions like these. Animals do not have the capacity of rational thinking. However, there's no evidence to suggest the opposite is true. Humans have a complicated language. Most language from animals are grunts and yelps, but humans are capable of speaking. There is no fundamental difference between grunts/yelps/speaking. All are vocal forms used to communicate. According to an evolutionary discovery at Harvard University, "The mental gap broadens when we compare human language with communication in other species." Animals are not capable of what humans speak. (Source) The same can be said about humans not being able to communicate the way animals do - for example chemically (ants) or via underwater sound generation (whales). That humans can communicate a lot better than animals doesn't mean that there is fundamental difference between humans and animals. Primates have been shown use complex language and communication. There are groups of non-primates who communicate using their own languages. The "Japanese Great Tit" has shown signs of grammar and syntax. (Source) Not enough research have been done on the language of different animals. There is a high probability that lots of animals have a more complicated language than we know now. We have creativity. Which means our intelligence is qualitatively different than any other organism on planet earth. A very large part of our intelligence is based in cognitive tools that we learned from others, which have slowly accumulated over the millennia. Our biggest difference with animals is not our intelligence, but our desire to imitate without direct reward, which is the basis of cumulative culture. Our biological cognitive differences are less pronounced than we tend to think. It's not a fundamental difference, as we just happened to evolve this way. Given different conditions, another species might've taken our place. There is no fundamental difference, only luck. Another species could have evolved the same traits. Humans just happened to be the first to. This has no bearing on whether humans are fundamentally different from other animals. Humans have more complex thought processes. Humans brains are more complex than the brains of other animals. The traits regarded as fundamentally human are actually extensions of non-fundamental traits. Creativity is a uniquely human trait. Our capacity to explain reality is our single defining feature. "While bigger in size, when viewed under the microscope the human brain is remarkably similar to those of non-human primates and lower mammals. At the cellular and molecular levels, there is little to distinguish our brain from those of species that preceded us in evolutionary history." (Source) In order to find the "fundamental difference" you'd have to first select humans from among evolutionary tree, and then search for any differences between us and the rest of other species. The differences we find this way, aren't fundamental in any way, only conventional. Humans are not fundamentally different from other animals. Human basic needs and wants are shared by animals Humans contain the traits of animals. Every animal is essentially based on the following rules: It must be a multicellular organism, it must have a well-defined shape, it must be able to move voluntarily, it must be able to actively acquire food and digest it internally, it must have sensory and nervous systems that allow them to respond rapidly to stimuli. All capabilities possessed by humans can be explained through acquired traits from prior forms. Multiple genetic experiments were conducted, proving that the similar genetic highlights disables us from classifying humans as different. For example, scientists have already created “transgenic” pigs by inserting a single human gene into the nucleus of a porcine zygote.  (Source) Humans can still be classified as a different species even if one human gene can be inserted into the genome of a non-human animal. A line could be drawn where traits of prior forms take a form so different, they cannot be considered the same. Humans also contain some traits that rocks have. That doesn't mean we can't draw a clear line between living and dead beings. Humans also contain several traits that other animals do not have; so although we share some similarities, our differences set us apart. Humans possess significantly more advanced cognitive abilities than any other species. Animals are mostly driven by instinct, while humans are largely driven by reason. Humans decide many of their actions based off of their conscience, while animals decide their actions based solely off of whether it will secure their survival. There are many instances of altruistic behavior in non-human animals. We have no proof that 'reason' is different from the natural chemical processes in the brain (instinct). As far as we know, humans are the only species capable of self-reflection and introspection. Gorillas demonstrate introspection and self-reflection. Humans have much more complex problem-solving skills than other animals and are able to think critically in ways that other species cannot. Humans have the ability to create, adapt, and use technology. Extreme specialization is not unusual among animals. This is simply humans' specialization. Similiarity does not imply equivalency. Without intensive training in language and skills, humans develop communication methods and behaviours more normally associated with other lesser primates. Consider the cannibalistic behaviour of the downed passengers in the Andes and other examples Humans have ethics, morals, and spiritual beliefs. Human's agree upon moral and ethical standards to follow. Human beings aren't that moral as they have damaged the planet and sky in a multitude of ways. Other animals have lived simply, never calling bulldozers, parking lots and disappearing forests progress. Humans have many disagreements about ethics and morality. Philosophy (the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language) is a study which many devote much of their lives to understanding and explaining, which would not be the case if humans had no disagreements about ethics and morality. We have evidence supporting the view that animals have developed morality. Humans can experience existential crises. We don't know if this is only human case. Primate suicide motivated by loneliness can be seen as an existential crises/decision. We don't know what it would look like if a fish had an existential crisis, therefore we cannot know if fish have existential crises. Only humans show signs of belief in spiritual world, God, life after death etc. It's really hard to know what animals is thinking, and not enough research have been done. Other animals maybe don't belive in human religions, but maybe the animals have some kind of believes that we don't know or can imagine. The difference between humans and animals is that humans have more developed brains, so we think of more complex subjects (as you mentioned). Specifically we have a part in our brain called neocortex that gives us this "complex" thinking. Other animals can also hold unsupported beliefs. Humans have free will. Humans do not have free will. -> See discussion #5685: There is no free will. -> See discussion #1379: The scientific worldview has demonstrated the impossibility of free will. Humans clearly have an greater cognitive and communal capacity than any other animals. While this sets us apart it is not a metaphysical difference, only a biological and evolutionary one. This is only valid if you artificially point a division line on the evolutionary continuum of species of different cognitive and comunal capacities. This is not a fundamental difference, because given different conditions, a different species might take our place. Humans have lesser communal capacity than eusocial animals, such as ants, bees and naked mole rats. Actions are motivated by belief, and we have no control over what we believe. Humans are influenced by their environment. Free will violates the law of cause and effect. Other animals (such as spiders, apes, dogs, etc.) have free will. They do not simply follow their natural and basic instinct (for instance urinate, eat, built webs, etc.) but they can decide when, where, and how to do so. This is still "free will" despite it has a different connotation from what we usually define "human free will": same concept different connotation/grade. Humans are the only living beings actively and conciously changing morals giving us tremendouse freedom to change and adapt our society a lot faster giving rise to social structures vastly more complex. Humans have a sense of self-awareness and individual identity. In the case of humans existence precedes essence, while in the case of animals essence precedes existence. Animals cannot go beyond their species. A crow will always be a crow; it won't decide to change his habits. Humans can choose to be artists, workers, writers or anything they want. The same could be say of humans. Humans will always be human. A human artist, a human worker etc. Crows have been exhibited changing their habits based on group information, e.g. a human carrying a dead crow will be communicated to the group, and even crows who never saw that human with the corpse will avoid it on the groups recommendation. Human choice (like animal choice) is limited to what's available and influenced by evolution and culture. Animals are individuals, meaning essentialism cannot apply to them. All animals change their behavior or habits based on environmental stimuli (including humans). Self-awareness is a sliding scale; from humans to neanderthals, chimps, dolphins, poodles, ravens etc. Culture and language are on that scale too; there is no 'hard break'. Humans have exponentially exceeded any self aware being, making us by magnitudes more capable of self awareness. ("making us capable" because I don't think all humans are equally placed on that scale and mental disabilities extend this range downwards. You can look up Peter Singer) All of the emotions humans experience are experienced by animals, simply to a lesser extent. The only thing making us "special" is the degree to which we can experience those emotions. Language is the tool which enables us to experience those emotions in a different context than animals. Many studies have shown that animals possess characteristics associated with sentience. Characteristics of sentience may be present, but many are genetically embedded (such as some moral aspects) and those characteristics left show orders of magnitude of less self awareness. You haven't shown that in human characteristics of sentience is not "genetically embedded". Neuroscience proves animals experience a wide range of emotions. Emotions are evolutionary advantages to signal damage or profit. They are a base for social behavior and while I suppose it is a building block for self awareness, it doesn't qualify as such. You do not control your emotions through your awareness (mostly), instead your awareness is regulated through emotions. Although on a biological continuum with other animals, it is humans' unique combination of features (embodied form, idealizing imagination, cumulative culture and tools, language, advanced cognition, etc) that set them distinctly apart from other animals. The fact that all of these things have been observed in other species suggests that humans are, at best, ahead of other species in terms of inevitable evolutionary advancement. Such distinction could be made between humans a few thousand years ago and humans today. No single human has the ability to make a satellite. This is the cumulative outcome of advances in civilization over thousands of years, enabled by greater intelligence and cognition, and not a fundamental difference from animals. Other animals have use of tools, but this does not compare with humans using very advanced tools. A bird or chimpanzee may use a stick for fairly short-term effect, but  a human may make satellites to predict the weather etc. If a comparison can be made, then we are talking about a difference of degree, not of kind. A stick is a tool. It was the original usage of the stick that allowed humanity to survive and thus create satellites. Prior technology paves advancement. All of these can also be found in the whale/dolphin family. Other animals also have uniqe constellations of features (other features), that set them distictly apart from other animals. Culture and technology differentiates humans from animals. If culture is a fundamental difference, then humans are fundamentally different from humans. Humans are not restricted by environmental or climate conditions. Humans are the most "successful" organism in their population size and variety of terrestrial (and extra-terrestrial) habitats occupied. No other animal can thrive in as great a variety of habitats as humans can. If population size and variety are the qualifiers then bacteria and beetles are the more "successful" organisms. Tardigrades and cockroaches are technically better than humans at surviving extreme conditions. Population size is not a strength humans have. We are outnumbered by many species, even by cows and chickens. There is no knowable difference between being the first (in geological timescale) species to do this vs being the only species to do this. Few humans live in extreme climates such as the poles and deserts. However animals did master those climates and can live there with no help from technology. Many humans have died as a result of environmental or climate conditions. Many humans have died as a result of either being too cold or because of diseases caught due to being affected by cold weather conditions. Many humans have died as a result of natural disasters. Humans have built technological systems that drastically improve natural disaster prediction and survival rates (Earthquake resistant buildings, hurricane tracking, tornado/storm warnings, estimates of where a tsunami will hit following an earthquake, etc.). Many humans have either died or had their living expectancy shortened as a result of pollution. Where many organisms can clearly make predictions, humans are unique in that we can string a chain of predictions together and create a narrative. Exchange plays a crucial role in the human society, whilst it is not as integral in an animal's society. “Exchange plays a crucial role in even the simplest foraging societies. In virtually every foraging group that has been carefully studied, food is shared widely in the band. Specialization and exchange are fundamentally cooperative. Except for the simplest exchanges, there is a time lag.”. (Evolution of Human Uniqueness, The Spanish Journal of Psychology, Volume 19, January 2016). Sharing resources is a practice common to many social/colony animals. Exchange may even include money. Exchange, inequality of exchange, reciprocity and a host of other related phenomenon have all been observed in other species. Humans have totaly dominated the earth, including changing of ecosystems and climate, and is causing mass extintion of species. Animals also change ecosystems. Look at the example of the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone Humans cooperate very differently than animals. Human society is dependent on cooperation to create public services or other mechanisms. "Public services" are not a concept in indigenous human groups that have had little or no contact with modern political systems. “Modern human societies strongly depend on high levels of cooperation between individuals, something we experience every day. Although some of these mechanisms are shared with other animal species, for others there is little or no evidence in non-human animals.” (Source) There are many, many social & cooperative species that also cooperate daily. Cooperation is more a commonality between humans and other animals, rather than a difference. We cooperate worse than some types of insects, such as termites, ants and bees. Better known as eusociality. Humans deal with different kind of tools that require specific kind of cooperation, like some people are responsible for killing and providing food resources so others can do something else. In the animal Kingdom it works different, they deal with limited tools(maybe cuz of the absence of our thumb, don't  know). A kind of similar cooperation occur when lion females are the ones responsibel for providing fodd and males works on defence. We have in-depth society and ability to communicate very complex ideas. This separates us from other animals. However, this is the only thing that separates us from other animals (other than opposable thumbs). Other animals have opposable thumbs. Human beings are by definition no more under the State of Nature, as Hobbes and Rousseau intend it. Levi Strauss in Tristes Tropiques enounces that it is impossible to consider humans could ever be on the same level as all other nature's creation, including animals stating that "such a state may not have existed, no more exists, and will never exist anymore". All animals rely on varying forms of communication, culture, and social ranks, humans are not so different from other animals. Many traits many consider exclusive to humans, such as communication, tool use, art etc. are in fact not. Neanderthals, homo habilis, Homo Erectus and many other species related to Homo Sapiens have demonstrated these abilities, as well as certain animals. Many Corvids use tools, most social animals communicate with one another, and Bowerbirds, Elephants and Gorillas have all been observed to create art. Animals have culture. Chimpanzees have metacognition (the Socratic paradox). Neuroscience proves that culture is nothing more than a larger number of neural connections. Charles Lumsden states, "All living things take in information and in turn respond based on the operating system they have. Humans have more inputs and a higher amount of neurons to make sense of those inputs compared to other animals, but the structure and function of the two systems are at their core the same."(Source) All animals are fundamentally different from each other, and there's nothing unique about humans that separate them from animals. In biology, fundamentals describe things like microbiology and genetics, in which humans are consistant with all animals. The fundamentals which give us uniue higher reasoning no more noteworthy than the unique size of blue whales. Biology only is a too simplistic view. Physically speaking we are made from the same things as stones. The value of humans is derived from Psychological and Sociological traits in which we by far exceed any other living being. Biology gives the best ground to compare different species. Psychology and sociology are fields of study, that take into account only humans. Therefore they are unable to show any differences between species. The difference Humans have to other living beings is far greater, due to many factors such as a moral understanding of suffering, and our capability to actively change ourselves and our environment for our benefit. Things like "moral understanding of suffering" are values that humans tend to ascribe to things that are biological and physical in nature. For that claim to be true you would have to show that no other animal ascribes such values to their experiences. Given what we know about animal's mental capacities, there is no reason to believe that they do. Most animals share fundamental traits such as having brains, lungs, and senses which allows them to perceive their surroundings. Some animals are only capable of living on land while others can only survive underwater.
